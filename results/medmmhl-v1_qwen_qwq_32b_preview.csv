2_fakenews_article/test;"Looking for answers about how the brain works amid age-related hearing loss, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers say they found that old mice were less capable than young mice of ""turning off"" certain actively firing brain cells in the midst of ambient noise. The result, they say, creates a ""fuzzy"" sound stage that makes it difficult for the brain to focus on one type of sound -- such as spoken words -- and filter out surrounding ""noise.""

Scientists have long linked inevitable age-related hearing loss to hair cells in the inner ear that become damaged or destroyed over time.

But the Johns Hopkins researchers say their new studies, described Dec. 7 in The Journal of Neuroscience, indicate that the brain has much to do with the condition, and it may be possible to treat such hearing loss by re-training the brain to tamp down the wildly firing neurons.

""There's more to hearing than the ear,"" says Patrick Kanold, Ph.D., professor of biomedical engineering at The Johns Hopkins University and School of Medicine. Kanold notes that most people will experience some kind of hearing loss after age 65, like the inability to pick out individual conversations in a bar or restaurant.

Kanold and his team recorded the activity of 8,078 brain cells, or neurons, in the auditory cortex brain region of 12 old mice (16-24 months old) and 10 young mice (2-6 months old).

First, the researchers conditioned the mice to lick a water spout when they heard a tone. Then, the same exercise was performed while playing ""white noise"" in the background.

Without the ambient noise, the old mice licked the water spout just as well as the young mice when they heard the tone.

When the researchers introduced the white noise, overall, the old mice were worse at detecting the tone and licking the spout than the young mice.

Also, the young mice tended to lick the spout at the onset or the end of the tone. Older mice licked it at the start of the tone cue but also showed licking before the tone was presented, indicating that they thought a tone was present when there wasn't one.

Next, to see how auditory neurons performed directly during such hearing tests, the researchers used a technique called two-photon imaging to peer into the auditory cortex in the mice. The technique uses fluorescence to identify and measure the activity of hundreds of neurons at the same time.

Under normal conditions, when brain circuitry worked correctly in the presence of ambient noise, some neuron activity increased when the mice heard the tone and, at the same time, other neurons became repressed, or turned off. In most of the old mice, however, the balance tipped to having mostly active neurons, and the neurons that were supposed to turn off when the tone was played in the presence of a noisy background failed to do so.

In addition, the researchers found that just before the tone cue, there was up to twice as much neuron activity in old mice than young mice, especially among males, causing the animals to lick the spout before the tone start.

A possible reason for that result, Kanold says, is that ""in the old mice, the brain may be 'firing' or behaving as if a tone is present, when it's not.""

The experiments with ambient noise also revealed that young mice experienced shifts in the ratio of active to inactive neurons, while older mice had more consistently active neurons overall. Thus, young mice could suppress the effects of ambient noise on neural activity while old mice could not, say the researchers.

""In older animals, ambient noise seems to make neuron activity more 'fuzzy,' disrupting the ability to distinguish individual sounds,"" says Kanold.

On the upside, Kanold believes that because of the mammalian brain's flexible learning potential, it can be ""taught"" to address the fuzziness in older animals, including humans.

""There may be ways to train the brain to focus on individual sound amid a cacophony of noise,"" he says.

Kanold notes that more research is needed to precisely map the connection between the inability to shut off certain neurons and hearing loss amid ambient sound, including the brain circuits involved and how they change with age, as well as the potential differences between male and female animals.

Other contributors to the research are Kelson Shilling-Scrivo and Jonah Mittelstadt from the University of Maryland.

4_fakenews_article/test;"A family history of cancer and genetic variants that might be inherited appear to be important risk factors for Black men diagnosed with early-onset prostate cancer, a study involving Duke Health researchers has found.

Kathleen Cooney, M.D., chair of the Duke Department of Medicine, is the senior author of the study appearing online on Nov. 29 in the journal JCO Precision Oncology.

Genetic studies usually recruit non-Hispanic white men, despite data showing that Black men are disproportionately affected by prostate cancer and more than twice as likely to die from the disease compared to their white counterparts.

Researchers looked to address this health disparity by identifying genetic variants in Black patients diagnosed with early-onset prostate cancer.

They sequenced germline DNA of 743 Black men diagnosed with prostate cancer at 62 years old or younger. This is DNA found in the men's sperm cells, meaning it would contain genetic changes that could be passed on to a child.

The focus was on DNA damage repair genes and HOXB13, a gene Cooney's research team found to be associated with hereditary prostate cancer in white men. Researchers identified 26 variants in 14 genes that could cause disease among 30 men, approximately 4% of the patients studied.

""We completed sequencing at Duke and our results reveal that men who had certain genetic variants were more likely to have a close relative diagnosed with cancer, have a higher prostate-specific antigen at time of diagnosis, and have more severe cases,"" Cooney said.

""We need to take a closer look at genetic associations to learn more about the susceptibility Black men have to developing prostate cancer,"" Cooney said. ""This could potentially reduce health disparities.""

The reason for poor outcomes among Black men diagnosed with prostate cancer includes both biological and societal causes, such as access to health care. Data from a previous study reveals genetic make-up may account for up to 40% of all prostate cancer cases.

""November is Men's Health Awareness Month and it's our hope that these findings help Black men become more aware of their susceptibility to early-onset prostate cancer,"" Cooney said. ""If men know they have a family history of cancer, it's important to talk to a doctor and consider genetic testing. If they end up having a mutation, they're encouraged to have cancer screenings earlier and more frequently.""

Additional authors of the study include Matthew Trendowski, Christopher Sample, Tara Baird, Azita Sadeghpour, David Moon, Julie Ruterbusch, and Jennifer Beebe-Dimmer.

5_fakenews_article/test;"Immunotherapy has transformed cancer care. In advanced melanoma, for example, the most fatal form of skin cancer, the five-year survival rate has risen from less than 10% to more than 50% since immunotherapy was introduced in 2011. Still, only about half of melanoma patients respond to immunotherapy, and those who do not respond face a difficult future.

Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have discovered that the difference between people who do and do not respond to immunotherapy may have to do with an immune cell known as CD5+ dendritic cells because they bear the protein CD5 on their outer surfaces. Their research showed that people with a variety of kinds of cancers, including melanoma, lived longer if they had more CD5+ dendritic cells in their tumors, and that mice that lacked CD5 on their dendritic cells were unable to respond well to immunotherapy.

The findings, published Feb. 17 in the journal Science, suggest that a supplementary therapy designed to increase the number or activity of CD5+ dendritic cells potentially could extend the lifesaving benefits of immunotherapy to more cancer patients.

""Immunotherapy has revolutionized the field of cancer therapy, but there are a lot of patients with cancer who don't benefit from it,"" said senior author Eynav Klechevsky, PhD, an assistant professor of pathology & immunology and a researcher at Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. ""Part of the reason some people do not respond well to some forms of immunotherapy is because this population of dendritic cells is reduced dramatically. We're developing some novel immune-based approaches to boost the activation of these CD5-expressing dendritic cells with a goal of helping more patients respond to immunotherapy.""

The immune system defends the body against cancer by activating immune cells known as T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells. In response, tumor cells manipulate the immune checkpoint system -- a safeguard that prevents T cells from mistakenly attacking healthy cells -- to hoodwink T cells into leaving them alone. Immune checkpoint blockade therapy works by thwarting tumor cells' manipulations, thereby freeing T cells to recognize and destroy tumors. But even with therapy, some people's T cells are unable to do their job effectively.

Klechevsky and colleagues -- including first author Mingyu He, PhD, a staff scientist, and co-author Kate Roussak, MD, a postdoctoral researcher -- suspected that people who don't respond to immunotherapy may have a problem with their dendritic cells. If T cells are the players on a soccer field, dendritic cells are the coaches who get the players pumped up for the game and give them instructions. Without dendritic cells, T cells are subdued and aimless.

By analyzing data in The Cancer Genome Atlas -- a public database with information on 20,000 tumors representing 33 cancer types -- Klechevsky and colleagues discovered that patients with types of skin, lung, bone and soft tissue, breast and cervical cancers fared better if they had higher levels of CD5+ dendritic cells in their tumors.

Further experiments with human cells and mice showed that CD5+ dendritic cells are required for effective T cell activity against tumors. CD5+ dendritic cells from people powerfully induced T cells to activate and multiply. Mice with tumors responded only weakly to immunotherapy and failed to reject the tumors if they lacked CD5 on their dendritic cells.

The findings suggest that the amount of CD5+ dendritic cells inside tumors could be used to help doctors assess which patients are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. They also suggest that increasing the numbers or the activity of such dendritic cells potentially could help more people benefit from immunotherapy. As part of this study, the researchers discovered that the immune protein IL-6 increases the amounts of CD5+ dendritic cells.

""We still don't completely understand how immunotherapies work,"" Klechevsky said. ""This study indicates that there is more we can do to increase the efficacy of these treatments. I'm confident that if we can find ways to harness these cells or expand these cells in patients, we can help more people.""";real;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;real;The article presents a scientific discovery about the role of CD5+ dendritic cells in cancer immunotherapy, supported by research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and published in the journal Science.

7_fakenews_article/test;"Obesity increases the risk of myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells that accumulate inside the bones.

And with current obesity trends in the United States and especially in South Texas, that's ominous.

""I'm predicting an increase in multiple myeloma,"" said Edward Medina, M.D., Ph.D., ""and with the obesity problems we see in the Hispanic population, there could be a serious health disparity on the horizon.""

Dr. Medina, a hematopathologist and assistant professor in the Department of Pathology at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, is looking at exactly how obesity causes an increased risk for myeloma.

What he and his colleagues have discovered is a potential way to not only boost the effectiveness of current chemotherapy treatments for myeloma, but at the same time a way to help the body help itself.

In a paper published this week in the journal Leukemia, Dr. Medina and his team look at an important little protein called adiponectin.

Myeloma is often called multiple myeloma because it occurs at many sites within the bone marrow. Healthy plasma cells produce antibodies that fight infection in the body, but myeloma cells produce high levels of abnormal antibodies that, when the cancer cells accumulate, they crowd out production of other important blood cells, both red and white.

""They basically overtake the bone marrow,"" Dr. Medina said.

The disease can lead to bone pain and fragility, confusion, excessive thirst and kidney failure. While survival rates for patients with myeloma have increased in recent years, many people do not live more than five years beyond diagnosis.

Adiponectin is a protective protein that plays several roles in keeping the body healthy, including killing cancer cells. While adiponectin is produced by fat cells, Medina said, obese people have less of it. The reason for this paradox is that in cases of obesity, fat cells function abnormally, including producing less adiponectin. What they produce more of, however, are fatty acids, and it is likely that myeloma cells can feed on these fatty acids.

""Synthesizing fatty acids is important for myeloma cells to build vital structures, including cell membranes, that enable them to keep on growing,"" Medina said.

Focusing on adiponectin led Dr. Medina's lab to protein kinase A or ""PKA"" -- a protein that, when activated by adiponectin, suppresses the fatty acids that myeloma cells need, leading to their demise.

The idea is to use the understanding of the pathways that adiponectin uses to kill myeloma cells to create a drug that would do the same thing.

""If we could pharmacologically suppress these fatty acid levels in obese myeloma patients, we could boost the effects of the chemotherapy that targets PKA or fatty acid synthesis, and potentially decrease the chemotherapeutic dose,"" Medina said. ""Also, it would give your own body's protective measures more of a chance to work against the cancer.""";real;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;real;The article presents a scientific study conducted by Dr. Edward Medina and his team at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, which investigates the link between obesity and the risk of myeloma, a type of blood cancer.

The study suggests that obese individuals have lower levels of adiponectin, which may contribute to an increased risk of myeloma. Additionally, the research explores how boosting adiponectin levels or targeting related pathways could enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy treatments for myeloma. The findings are published in a reputable journal, Leukemia, adding credibility to the claims made in the article. Therefore, the claim that obesity increases the risk of myeloma is supported by this scientific research, making it a real concern, especially given the rising obesity rates in the United States and among the Hispanic population in South Texas.;682;211
8_fakenews_article/test;"Michigan State University physicians have found that vitamin D, if taken for at least three years, could help cancer patients live longer.

The findings suggest that the vitamin carries significant benefits other than just contributing to healthy bones and were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting on June 3, 2019.

In the United States, cancer is the second leading cause of death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""Vitamin D had a significant effect on lowering the risk of death among those with cancer, but unfortunately it didn't show any proof that it could protect against getting cancer,"" said Tarek Haykal, a lead author on the study and an internal medicine resident physician at Michigan State University and Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Michigan.

10_fakenews_article/test;"Allergy seasons are likely to become longer and grow more intense as a result of increasing temperatures caused by humanmade climate change, according to new research from the University of Michigan.

By the end of this century, pollen emissions could begin 40 days earlier in the spring than we saw between 1995 and 2014. Allergy sufferers could see that season last an additional 19 days before high pollen counts may subside.

In addition, thanks to rising temperatures and increasing CO levels, the annual amount of pollen emitted each year could increase up to 200%.

""Pollen-induced respiratory allergies are getting worse with climate change,"" said Yingxiao Zhang, a U-M graduate student research assistant in climate and space sciences and engineering and first author of the paper in Nature Communications. ""Our findings can be a starting point for further investigations into the consequence of climate change on pollen and corresponding health effects.""

U-M researchers developed a predictive model that examines 15 of the most common pollen types and how their production will be impacted by projected changes in temperatures and precipitation. They combined climate data along with socioeconomic scenarios, correlating their modeling with the data from 1995 through 2014. They then used their model to predict pollen emissions for the last two decades of the 21st century.

Allergies symptoms run the gamut from the mildly irritating, such as watery eyes, sneezing or rashes, to more serious conditions, such as difficulty breathing or anaphylaxis. According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, 30% of adults and 40% of children suffer from allergies in the U.S.

The grasses, weeds and trees that produce pollen are affected by climate change. Increased temperatures cause them to activate earlier than their historical norms. Hotter temperatures can also increase the amount of pollen produced.

Allison Steiner, U-M professor of climate and space sciences and engineering, said the modeling developed by her team could eventually allow for allergy season predictions targeted to different geographical regions.

13_fakenews_article/test;"An antibiotic commonly used to treat a variety of serious infections may also help prevent dementia in HIV patients, according to a test-tube study of human brain cells by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine neurologist Jeffrey Rumbaugh, M.D., Ph.D.

Results of the lab study with ceftriaxone are expected to be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 58th annual meeting on April 5 in San Diego, Calif.

Rumbaugh added that, although ceftriaxone is FDA approved and could be used at any time by patients suffering from HIV dementia, there is not yet enough data to support doing so.

The study looked at two proteins, called Tat and gp120, that are part of the virus that causes HIV infection and that are implicated in the development of HIV dementia, according to Dr. Rumbaugh, the study's lead author. HIV is the only virus that makes Tat and gp120, which are produced during its normal life cycle, though other viruses make similar proteins. Dementia is a common side effect of long-term HIV infection, but there are no known specific treatments for this complication. According to Rumbaugh, Tat and gp120 are believed to cause dementia by reducing the expression of a brain chemical called EAAT-2 (excitatory amino acid transporter-2). EAAT-2 absorbs the neurotransmitter glutamate from the space between neurons (the synapse), thereby preventing excess neuronal excitation, which in turn can cause cell death and brain damage.

Ceftriaxone, used to treat pneumonias, sexually transmitted diseases, bacterial meningitis and other infections, is a known stimulator of EAAT-2 expression and protects against neuronal injury in mice with nervous system disorders. To test ceftriaxone's potential in HIV, Rumbaugh and colleagues grew human neuronal cell cultures in a lab from existing human neuron cell lines, treated them with a range of doses of ceftriaxone, and exposed them to Tat or gp120. They found that the antibiotic protected the neurons against both HIV proteins. The dose of ceftriaxone needed for protection was well within the range currently used for treatment of bacterial infections.

""These results indicated that this class of drugs may prove effective in treating HIV patients with dementia,"" Rumbaugh says.

About 500,000 people in the United States alone have HIV dementia. And although new cases of HIV dementia have declined over the last 10 years (due to the increased availability of effective HIV treatments), the prevalence of HIV dementia is on the rise since people are living longer with HIV.

""We hope this research might help many patients with other forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's, and infections of the brain, like herpes encephalitis and West Nile encephalitis,"" says Rumbaugh. ""However, it will require a lot more development before drugs like these can be used even to treat patients with HIV dementia, let alone to treat patients with other neurological diseases.""

14_fakenews_article/test;"Research from Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy at Rutgers University demonstrates that a drug used to treat Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS) helps radiation be more effective when it was administered to laboratory models with melanoma that had metastasized to the brain.f

Melanoma -- the deadliest of skin cancers -- is often resistant to radiation therapy. To address this resistance, some melanoma treatment regimens may call for large doses of radiation, however there is a risk of neurotoxicity when large doses are administered to the whole brain. The work, published in the current print edition of Pigment Cell & Melanoma Research, examines radiation treatment when combined with the drug riluzole and its impact on melanoma that has spread to the brain.

Riluzole targets a protein known as GRM1 that is often abnormally produced by melanoma cells. Activation of this protein on the surface of melanoma cells increases growth and spread of the disease. Riluzole is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ALS (a disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord) and has been shown to block activation of the GRM1 protein.

In this current research, investigators used four sets of laboratory models affected with melanoma brain metastasis. One group was treated with a drug absorption vehicle known as dimethyl sulfoxide, while another was treated with dimethyl sulfoxide plus a weekly radiation dose of 4 Gy. A third group was treated daily with riluzole only, and the fourth received both daily riluzole and the weekly radiation dose of 4 Gy. What they found was a decrease in tumor cell growth over a 37 day period when riluzole and radiation were combined as compared to those models that were given dimethyl sulfoxide only or riluzole alone or radiation alone.

""What this indicates is that riluzole sensitizes GRM1, helping these proteins act like a beacon for radiation so that only melanoma cells with the GRM1 protein will be targeted, sparing the rest of the brain and preserving the brain's functionality,"" notes senior author, Suzie Chen, PhD, Cancer Institute member and professor of chemical biology at the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy.

15_fakenews_article/test;"An investigation by WebMD and Georgia Health News. Nov. 29, 2018 -- Randy Strickland walked into the ER at North Metro Medical Center burning with fever and trembling. He told the man and the woman who were staffing the triage desk that he was nauseated and felt like he needed to throw up. The emergency room was nearly empty. Randy was a volunteer at the Jacksonville, AR, hospital and hoped he would get home quickly. But repeated visits by his wife, Mary, and son James to the triage desk didn't bring Randy any closer to getting care. Over the next 2 hours, he lost his ability to speak or respond to questions. His breathing became labored. Finally, on a trip to the bathroom, his legs buckled as he held onto Mary for support. “I can't hold him up!” Mary yelled as she pounded on the wall that separated the bathroom from the triage desk, trying to summon the ER attendants. When no help came, James picked up his phone and dialed 911. Could they take his dad to a different ER? he asks the operator, according to a transcript of the call. “I'm sorry sir, my ambulance will not respond to a hospital,"" the operator responds. “Have you tried talking to them or anything?” “It's just -- I don't know what they're waiting for,” James says. After a pause, the dispatcher asks if they can get Randy out to his car in the parking lot, where paramedics could pick him up. James and Mary wheeled Randy outside in a drenching rain and slid him into the back seat of their gray Toyota RAV4. When the paramedics pulled up, Mary says, they knew immediately that Randy was too sick to be taken to another hospital. They took him back into the ER through an entrance used by ambulance crews, and the hospital's medical teams finally jumped into action. But by that time, Randy was critically ill. A team of doctors and nurses struggled for about an hour to save him. Finally, a doctor came to speak with Mary.

While violators over the 10 years represent about a third of hospitals across the United States, the chances of any individual trip to the ER resulting in a documented violation are very low. In 2016, for example, there were just 459 EMTALA violations across the country out of 142.6 million emergency room visits, according to the American Hospital Association. Yet experts say the raw numbers don't accurately reflect both the scope and severity of the problems they see. That's because enforcement of the law depends on someone filing a complaint. Although anyone can file a complaint, it's most often a doctor, nurse, or hospital administrator. Howie Mell, MD, an emergency doctor in Chicago and a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, says that when someone from a hospital makes a complaint about what happened at another hospital, both hospitals are investigated. While complaints are anonymous, investigations can be rigorous, and they often catch smaller violations -- like failing to post signs about patient rights in an emergency room -- along with larger ones that directly affect patient care. “That system of going after both sides really discourages people from complaining,” says Mell. Given that fact, he says, when you do see an EMTALA violation recorded in the system, it's usually because something really serious happened. “They were either really egregious, or what you're seeing is the tip of the iceberg” for that hospital, Mell says. EMTALA, signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, was designed to prevent the practice of so-called wallet biopsies -- where hospitals would turn away patients who couldn't prove they had financial resources like health insurance to pay for their care. Those patients ended up at public hospitals, often in unstable conditions. They died about three times more often than patients who were not transferred this way, according to an influential 1986 study on the practice. While this kind of patient dumping still happens, it appears to be far less common than it used to be. Instead, our investigation found that hospitals seem to be breaking the law because they lack the resources to provide the level of care the law requires.

“The problem is that the majority of the EMTALA fines that are out there are not egregious money-grubbing things. They are not wallet biopsies. They are literally the emergency room or the staff of a hospital running up against a lack of resources,” says Mell. “An EMTALA [violation] usually implies you don't have the resources to take care of the patient at your facility. Smaller hospitals have fewer resources,” says Boykin Robinson, MD, an emergency doctor who runs the Atlanta-based Core Clinical Partners, a company that staffs emergency rooms. Our data analysis found that hospitals that violate EMTALA are most likely to be smaller hospitals, or those with fewer than 100 beds. They accounted for 1,488 violations over the decade, more than any other group. According to statistics from the American Hospital Association, hospitals with fewer than 100 beds accounted for about half of all hospitals in the U.S. in 2016. That makes sense to Ryan Kerr, a former nurse and an attorney with Arnall Golden Gregory, a law firm that consults with hospitals. He says smaller hospitals often lack services to fully examine or stabilize emergency patients. Under the law, that means they may need to transfer patients more often, a process that can easily go awry. “Each of these transfers create an opportunity for the hospital to inadvertently violate EMTALA if the hospital could have stabilized the patient or the hospital committed an error in the transfer process,” Kerr says. That's what happened to Theresa Kuhn, 58, a nurse and high school health sciences teacher from Social Circle, GA. Kuhn had a routine outpatient procedure on Friday, Dec. 11, 2015, to look for the cause of some post-menopausal bleeding. By Sunday morning, she was in unbearable pain. Her doctor's office advised going to the closest emergency room. That was at Piedmont Newton Hospital, a 103-bed hospital in nearby Covington. To take her to Gwinnett Medical Center, the hospital system that had originally treated her, would have taken them another hour, says her ex-husband Brian Kuhn, of Conyers, GA, who drove her to the hospital.

An X-ray performed in the emergency room at Piedmont Newton revealed a puncture in her bowel that was leaking into her abdomen. A doctor in the ER told Theresa she needed surgery. But they waited. And waited. Brian says he knew that was dangerous. He asked the nurse, “Well, if she has a hole poked in her bowel and the fluid comes out -- isn't that poisonous?” “Shouldn't we be concerned about time?” Brian asked. Eventually, another doctor, the hospital surgeon, came to speak to them. She told Brian she had been making arrangements to transfer Theresa to the 500-bed Gwinnett Medical Center in Lawrenceville for her urgently needed surgery. Brian was stunned. A medical helicopter came to pick up Theresa. It was 5:30 p.m. By that time, she had spent nearly 4 hours in the Piedmont Newton ER. Theresa vomited midflight, sending stomach contents into her lungs and worsening her condition. The doctor who did her original procedure met Brian and Theresa's daughter, Lauren, and told them he was going to rush Theresa into surgery. They removed part of her colon and took out the surrounding infection. Brian says the doctor told them the surgery went well. But Theresa never woke up. Hooked up to a ventilator and in septic shock, she died the next day. Federal investigators cited Piedmont Newton for failing to stabilize Theresa and for transferring her to another hospital even though it wasn't safe to move her. In their report on the case, investigators determined the surgeon who transferred Theresa had the skill and resources to perform the needed operation. In an interview with investigators, the surgeon says in her 34 years of practice, she'd never heard of EMTALA and wasn't familiar with the law, records show. Piedmont Healthcare, which acquired the Newton hospital just months before the incident, declined to comment on the specifics of Theresa's case or the violations they were cited for as a result. Like the other families interviewed for this story, Theresa's relatives had no idea that her case had been the subject of a federal investigation. “I felt in my heart that this was 100% preventable,” says Sarah Homer, Theresa's sister who lives in Tampa, FL. She's taking care of Lauren, who was in college when Theresa died. “The delay in treatment was just shocking to us,” she says.

Small hospitals are more likely to serve more rural populations. They're also more likely than larger hospitals to be financially fragile, says Jimmy Lewis, CEO of HomeTown Health, an association of rural hospitals in Georgia and Florida. At Hill Hospital of Sumter County in York, AL, a rural community just across the state line from Mississippi, federal investigators found an envelope labeled N.P.A. -- for “No Physician Available.” It contained records on 38 patients who came to the emergency room for help when there was no doctor there to treat them at the 27-bed facility. The cases, which included two deaths, spanned a 4-month period from 2017 to 2018. The violations were so serious, the federal government threatened to end the hospital's contract with Medicare, though that didn't happen. One of those patients was Quarmaine Seals, a 25-year-old truck driver and father of two young children. He was also a motorcycle enthusiast. According to a police report, he was riding a motorcycle down a two-lane highway in York the night of Sept. 1, 2017, when a car backed out of a driveway onto the rural road in front of him. The police report estimates Seals was traveling 100 miles per hour in a 35-mile-per-hour zone. He struck the passenger side door and flew 30 feet over the car. Witnesses found him thrown into the bushes, his body wrapped around a metal hand railing along the walkway to a house. Paramedics showed up within 10 minutes and took Seals to the closest emergency room at Hill Hospital, where there was no doctor to treat him. An air ambulance was dispatched from Mississippi to pick him up from Hill Hospital, according to federal records While EMTs waited for it to arrive, they tried to revive Seals in a trauma room at the hospital. He was pronounced dead over the phone by the doctor who was remotely directing the air ambulance crew. In this small town, where everyone knows everyone else, Willie Seals, Quarmaine's mother, had been called about the accident and was already at the hospital when they wheeled her son's broken body into a trauma room.

The stress of seeing him caused her to collapse. Paramedics loaded her into an ambulance and drove her to the next closest hospital, in Meridian, MS, for care. “They took me, but they didn't take him,” she says. “I got the ambulance ride he should have had.” “It destroyed me because I felt like had a doctor been there, they could have done more for my son.” A year after the accident, she still dreams about Quarmaine. She cries in her sleep. “Not a day goes by when I don't miss my son. He was only 25. He wasn't through living.” Gena Springfield, a former nurse who worked at Hill Hospital off and on for 2 to 3 years, says the hospital was having trouble paying its staff, even as far back as 2014, when she was there. “That's why I quit working there, because they couldn't pay the nurses, they couldn't pay the doctors. We didn't have the things we needed to work there with. I mean, it was dangerous,” she says. Federal investigators concluded that conditions at the hospital placed patients in “immediate jeopardy.” They gave the hospital 90 days to improve or lose federal funding, a move that almost certainly would have meant its closure. The hospital has since been taken off the immediate jeopardy list. When asked why the hospital had struggled to keep a doctor in its ER, administrator Loretta Wilson declined to comment on the specifics of the violation. In general, she says Hill Hospital faces many of the same challenges as other small, rural hospitals. “We have a lot of people who come to our hospital who can't pay. We have to provide these services. Nobody pays for that. We don't have the population with access to insurance,” Wilson says. Wilson also says staff had cut their own salaries just to keep the hospital running. But federal regulations require hospitals that take reimbursements from Medicare or Medicaid to offer a certain level of care in emergencies. When resources fall short, they're supposed to notify CMS and local ambulance crews that they can't take emergency patients. They're also supposed to post a public notice. Hill Hospital failed to do that.

In Quarmaine Seals' case, no one had told the paramedics who brought him to the hospital that it didn't have a doctor available. Problems like those at Hill Hospital show what some people call a downside of the law. Hospitals are required to serve everyone whether they can pay or not. “Care can be quite expensive, and there's no money that would pay for that care, which is required. That's where we get into the unfunded mandate. We agree with the mandate; we just think there ought to be funds available to pay for it,” says Michael Carius, MD, a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, or ACEP. ACEP has worked with Congress to introduce two bills to try to relieve some of the financial pressure that the law creates for hospitals. The first would create a way to get the government to reimburse hospitals when they provide care that isn't paid for. The second approach, which is less direct, would shield doctors who treat ER patients from lawsuits, Carius says. But so far, neither of the bills has gained any traction in Congress. Cheryl Fish-Parcham, director of access initiatives for the nonprofit advocacy group Families USA, says that EMTALA has largely been forgotten. “I think it's really important that there be strong enforcement of this law because consumers are not in a position to enforce this themselves,” she says. Before 2015, fines levied under EMTALA had been authorized under the Social Security Act and were exempt from adjustment for inflation. That means in 30 years, they'd never gone up, says April Washington, a spokeswoman for CMS. Each violation could cost a doctor or hospital up to $50,000. The penalty for hospitals with fewer than 25 beds was $25,000 per violation. In 2015, Congress passed the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act, which effectively doubled EMTALA fines and those levied by other federal agencies “to maintain their deterrent effect,” says Washington. Now, doctors and hospitals face up to $104,826 for each violation.

The adjustment recently resulted in the largest fine ever levied against a hospital for an EMTALA violation -- nearly $1.3 million. The nonprofit AnMed hospital system, which serves South Carolina, settled with the Justice Department after investigators found the three hospitals were “boarding” dozens of mental health patients in their emergency room for as long as 38 days when they had open psychiatric beds at the same facilities. The patients had been involuntarily committed. The hospital had a longstanding policy of transferring involuntarily committed patients to the state psychiatric hospital, rather than accepting them to their in-house psychiatric unit, according to news reports. The state mental hospital was short of space, prompting long waits for transfer. AnMed launched a plan of correction in 2015, which was accepted by CMS. The plan called for adding security and making structural changes to its own behavioral health unit so that it could accept involuntarily committed patients, according to a hospital statement. They also added staff, gave existing staff more training, and came up with new ways for doctors to care for involuntarily committed behavioral health patients, the statement says. “AnMed Health continues to work with state and local mental health agencies to improve health care for the behavioral health population,” according to a written statement. The massive fine was seen by some health law experts as a warning to hospitals that CMS was beefing up its response to hospitals that don't follow EMTALA when it comes to mental health. Jay Bhatt, senior vice president and chief medical officer at the American Hospital Association, says hospitals take the law “very seriously.” “Hospitals strive to stabilize and treat all patients with emergent medical needs. When a hospital does not have an available bed or does not offer the treatment a patient needs, it will transfer the patient to another hospital that does have the capability,” Bhatt says. He says that it can sometimes be challenging to find the right treatment facility. Washington of CMS says the federal agency is looking at other ways to boost EMTALA enforcement, too. For example, most cases are investigated and enforced by state health care regulators that contract with the federal government. That's not always an effective system, especially if state regulators are too stretched or too intimidated by their local hospitals to offer strong enforcement.

To remedy that, CMS says it’s providing technical support to help state survey agencies with difficult investigations. And the federal agency added that it has increased outreach and support to medical providers so they can understand EMTALA requirements. “EMTALA is fundamentally the Golden Rule of emergency care, codified by Congress,” says Richard Wild, MD, a CMS regional chief medical officer. “Every hospital should strive to provide every person who presents symptoms in an emergency department with the best care. There should be one standard of care -- their best care.” But for now, patients wouldn't necessarily know they've arrived at a struggling facility until it's too late. North Metro, the hospital where Randy Strickland died, is a 64-bed hospital in Jacksonville, AR, a suburb about 20 minutes northeast of Little Rock. Once a vital part of the town, the facility has fallen on hard times in recent years. The hospital owes millions to the federal government for back taxes and fraudulent Medicare billing, and it faced several lawsuits from vendors who were not paid. Staff turnover has been high. The hospital has had six CEOs in the last 5 years and a string of medical chiefs of staff. Medicare's Hospital Compare website gives the hospital 1 out of 5 stars for quality. It lags state and national averages for several measures of “timely and effective care.” At North Metro, for example, patients with chest pain wait an average of 70 minutes before they get an EKG -- a test that helps to diagnose a heart attack. In the rest of the state and nation, patients with chest pain wait an average of just 7 minutes before they get that test, the data show. Only 3% of patients treated at North Metro received the right care for sepsis or septic shock, compared with 47% of such patients in Arkansas and 49% of patients nationally. Tracy Phillips, DO, was the hospital's chief of staff when he treated Randy Strickland the night he died. Phillips says he was at a concert when he got a call from a doctor on duty that he needed help with a patient. He says he was at the hospital within 10 minutes.

Phillips was eventually able to put a tube down Randy's throat to help him breathe and insert an IV, but those measures came nearly 3 hours too late. “He was septic,” Phillips says in a recent interview. “It was septic shock.” “My first question was, 'What took so long?' ” Phillips says. “That's when I started investigating it.” The clerk at the front desk had told James, Randy's son, that they couldn't take Randy back because they were attending to a priority patient. But Phillips, who left North Metro in December 2017, says his investigation found that there was no priority patient. The nurse on duty had left early -- about a half-hour before the end of her shift -- without telling anyone, Phillips says. The ER clerk and another woman who was staffing the reception desk had failed to recognize how sick Randy was. The ER doctor did not know the situation because Randy was not sent to a room in the back to be seen. After Randy's case, Phillips says he changed ER triage procedures so that patients with low blood pressures or rapid heart rates were brought straight back to see a doctor. “They just didn't bring the guy back. They didn't think he was that sick,” Phillips says. “There was a mistake made,” he says. “That should never, ever, ever have happened.

21_fakenews_article/test;"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscle disease in children and is passed on by X-linked recessive inheritance. Characteristic is a progressive muscular atrophy. The disease often results in death before the third decade of life. Researchers of the Universities of Maynooth (Ireland) and Bonn have found a connection between dystrophic muscles and the lymphatic system in mice with Duchenne disease. The results have now been published in the journal iScience.

The muscular atrophy in Duchenne disease is caused by a lack of dystrophin, a protein of the cytoskeleton. In vertebrates, dystrophin is found in the muscle fiber membrane and is important for muscle contraction. Although the disease is principally caused by a defective single gene (DMD gene), as a primarily neuromuscular disease it also has far-reaching and complex health-relevant effects on non-muscular tissues and organ systems.

In recent years, the research groups associated with Prof. Dr. Dieter Swandulla, Physiological Institute of the University of Bonn, and Prof. Dr. Kay Ohlendieck, National University of Ireland, Maynooth, have used mass spectrometric protein analysis (proteomics) to show that Duchenne muscular dystrophy causes changes in the respective set of proteins (proteome) in a number of organs including heart, brain, kidney and liver as well as in saliva, serum and urine.

""Proteomics is a reliable and effective analytical method for identifying disease-specific marker proteins that provide information about the course of the disease, possible therapeutic targets and the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions,"" says senior author Prof. Swandulla.

In the current study, the researchers used proteomics in mice suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy to model how the skeletal muscles and the spleen influence each other in view of the dystrophin deficiency. The spleen plays a key role in the immune response and is located in the abdominal cavity near the stomach. It ensures the proliferation of lymphocytes, which are white blood cells, and also stores monocyte-type immune cells and disposes of worn-out red blood cells.

The researchers used the Duchenne mice to decode for the first time the set of proteins (proteome) of the spleen in comparison to healthy control animals and created a comprehensive protein archive for this organ. ""The mice with Duchenne disease showed numerous changes in the proteomic signature of the spleen compared to the controls,"" says Prof. Kay Ohlendieck of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.

Furthermore, the researchers found for the first time a shorter form of dystrophin (DP71), which is synthesized as a protein in the spleen. ""This dystrophin variant is apparently not affected by the disease because it occurs unchanged in Duchenne mice,"" says Swandulla. The ""crosstalk"" is expressed especially by the fact that a large number of proteins in the spleen are drastically reduced due to the loss of the long form of dystrophin. ""This includes proteins that are involved in lipid transport and metabolism and in the immune response and inflammatory processes.""

Furthermore, the study provides evidence that the loss of the long form of dystrophin, as observed in Duchenne muscular dystrophy in skeletal muscle, apparently causes secondary effects in the lymphatic system. ""It's a real 'crosstalk' between skeletal muscles and the lymphatic system,"" says lead author Dr. Paul Dowling of Maynooth University.

The term ""crosstalk"" is used, for example, when there is a disruptive overlay of another conversation on the phone that can be heard in the background. In the specific case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the ""crosstalk"" was particularly expressed by the fact that the short form of the dystrophin was still produced as normal in the spleen, but there were disruptive changes of the proteomic signature in the other protein species.

The researchers point out that the results of the study suggest that the mechanisms of the inflammatory processes which occur in the course of Duchenne muscular dystrophy merit special attention. This is because these inflammatory mechanisms are an important feature of muscle fiber degeneration and contribute significantly to the progression of the disease. ""The specific interactions of the dystrophin deficiency with the immune system might therefore open up new therapeutic approaches,"" says Prof. Swandulla.";real;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;real;The article presents a detailed and scientifically grounded discussion about Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a well-known genetic disorder. It accurately describes the nature of DMD, its inheritance pattern, and its progressive impact on muscle function. The article also highlights recent research findings from studies conducted by universities in Ireland and Germany, which have explored the connection between dystrophic muscles and the lymphatic system in mice with DMD. The use of proteomics to analyze changes in protein expression in various organs, including the spleen, is consistent with current scientific methodologies in understanding complex diseases like DMD. The identification of a shorter form of dystrophin (DP71) in the spleen and its potential role in the disease process adds to the existing knowledge about dystrophin variants and their functions in different tissues. The concept of 'crosstalk' between skeletal muscles and the lymphatic system, as suggested by the study, implies a bidirectional influence between these systems in the context of DMD, which is a novel and intriguing aspect that could have implications for future therapeutic strategies. The article's stance is real as it reflects actual scientific research and understanding of DMD, supported by evidence from peer-reviewed publications and expert opinions in the field.;964;263

23_fakenews_article/test;"In a study using a first-of-its kind mouse model of aging that mimics breast cancer development in estrogen receptor-positive post-menopausal women, investigators at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and colleagues have determined that over-expression, or switching on of the Esr1 gene, could lead to elevated risk of developing estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in older women.

In a second study from the same research lab, investigators found that in the specially bred mice given anti-hormonal drugs (e.g., tamoxifen and letrozole) similar to those currently used by women to lower their breast cancer risk, the elevated risk of developing breast cancer due to over-expression of Esr1 could be lowered or reversed.

The findings appeared simultaneously December 1, 2022, in the American Journal of Pathology.

""In the clinic, we currently use tests for over-expression of particular patterns of genes to predict the probability of whether a woman's breast cancer could become metastatic,"" says Priscilla Furth, M.D., professor of oncology and medicine at Georgetown Lombardi and corresponding author of both studies. ""If validated in human studies, detection of over-expression of Esr1-related genes could be a new signature to add to current prognostic tools that would help post-menopausal women at risk for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer decide what their best risk reduction strategy might be.""

Most women start menopause in their late 40s or early 50s, with a risk of increased new cases of breast cancer peaking around 70 years of age. A substantial proportion of these breast cancers are fed by over-expression of the Esr1gene, resulting in higher expression of related estrogen pathway genes that help spur breast cancer development.

During human menopause, when overall estrogen levels typically decline, the breast tissue of some women can show an increase in expression levels of the estrogen receptor or even increased levels of local estrogen production. To model this in mice, the investigators followed the mice as they aged through their natural reproductive cycle and decreased circulating estrogen levels. They then looked to see what factors were involved in resulting cancers by comparing outcomes in mice that were designed to overexpress one of two different genes: Esr1, which would model the increase in estrogen receptor levels, or CYP19A1, a gene that models the increase in local estrogen production. They found that Esr1 over-expression resulted in more breast cancers than CYP19A1 overexpression and was accompanied by high activation of estrogen pathway genes.

In the second study, they gave the mice estrogen-suppressive drugs, such as tamoxifen and letrozole, as a preventive measure to see if the drugs could resolve abnormal activation of estrogen pathway genes, which indeed turned out to be the case.

The investigators were guided in their study by the use of the PAM50 (Prediction Analysis of Microarray 50) prognostic tool. The tool reads a sample of the tumor and determines expression levels for a group of 50 genes. The scientists found that many genes related to proliferation of breast cancer cells in the PAM50 tool were significantly expressed only in Esr1 mice and this correlated with development of the same type of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers that develop in humans, thereby giving them new evidence of which other genes might be implicated in inducing breast cancer in post-menopausal women. In current clinical practice, the results of the PAM50 test have helped predict the chance of metastasis for some ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers.

""One of the more important challenges in translating our findings from mice to people is the collection of breast cancer cells for testing with PAM50 or other prognostic tools,"" says Furth. ""Removing breast tissue, even with a fine needle, is still invasive and perhaps unavoidable. However, we have developed a method in my lab that requires collecting just a few tumor cells from a small tissue sample, as our process expands and grows the cells many-fold so that we can have adequate cancer cell numbers to run through prognostic tools like PAM50.""

The scientists are hoping other researchers, including commercial prognostic tool developers, take note of this research advance and incorporate risk factors associated with some of the genes linked to Esr1 in their tools, potentially enabling women to better avoid over-treatment or make more precise treatment choices.";real;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;real;The claim is supported by robust scientific evidence from studies using a novel mouse model of aging, which mimics breast cancer development in post-menopausal women. The research demonstrates that overexpression of the Esr1 gene increases the risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and that anti-hormonal drugs can mitigate this risk. The findings are published in a reputable peer-reviewed journal and have potential implications for improving prognostic tools and informing risk reduction strategies in human patients.;954;634
24_fakenews_article/test;"Offering intensive, weekly telephone-based cessation counseling along with nicotine replacement for people who smoke and who were undergoing screening for lung cancer resulted in over a two-fold greater cigarette quit rate compared to people who received minimal counseling and nicotine replacement, according to results of a national, randomized trial conducted by investigators at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center and colleagues.

The findings appeared July 12, 2022, in JNCI and will be presented at the 2022 World Conference on Lung Cancer in Vienna, Austria, in August 2022.

People with a long-term smoking history are at high risk for lung cancer. Screening with computed tomography (CT) scans can potentially detect lung nodules early so that the disease can be treated in its less advanced stages. When undergoing CT screening, people are routinely offered cessation support, including counseling and nicotine replacement, to help them quit.

""Quitting smoking is very difficult and people who seek medication and support are more successful than those who try to quit on their own,"" says Kathryn L. Taylor, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Oncology and a member of the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center's Cancer Prevention and Control Program, and corresponding author of the study. ""Importantly, making a quit attempt while undergoing lung screening may provide a boost to one's motivation to stop smoking.""

The Georgetown Lung Screening, Tobacco, and Health trial randomized 818 people between 50 to 80 years of age with a 20-plus pack year smoking history (e.g., smoking two packs a day for a ten-year period equals 20 pack years). Enrollees at eight lung screening sites nationwide were randomly assigned to either intensive phone counseling of eight, 20-minute sessions along with up to eight weeks of nicotine patches, or three counseling sessions and two weeks of patches, which is similar to what many state tobacco quitlines currently offer people who call seeking assistance with quitting.

During the counseling sessions, tobacco treatment specialists discussed smoking-related goals, nicotine patch use, strategies to address triggers for smoking, readiness to quit, and confidence and motivation to quit.

""Tobacco treatment specialists met participants where they were in their readiness to quit -- which ranged from not being ready to make any changes at the moment, but willing to talk about smoking, versus being very ready to quit and wanting specific ideas for making changes to their smoking habits,"" notes Randi M. Williams, PhD, MPH, assistant professor in the Department of Oncology at Georgetown and second author of the study.

Self-reported 3-month quit rates were significantly higher in the intensive vs. minimal groups (14.3% vs. 7.9%). Importantly, quit rates that were verified by saliva strips or carbon monoxide tests were lower but with similar relative differences between groups (9.1% vs. 3.9%) of about two-to-one. Compared to the minimal arm, the intensive arm was more effective at spurring cessation among people with greater nicotine dependence (about a 3½ times greater benefit), normal screening results (over a 2½ times greater benefit), high engagement in counseling (a 3 times greater benefit) and patch use (a nearly 3 times greater use). Bolstering the value of intensive counseling for smoking cessation was a companion article appearing concurrently in JNCI Cancer Spectrum and led by researchers at the University of Michigan. The researchers found that even modest cessation rates achieved with intensive telephone counseling and nicotine replacement in the study group of people currently smoking and receiving lung screening led to savings in costs and lives compared to screening alone and would therefore be considered very cost-effective.

""Although the quit rates were modest overall, when comparing 3-month and12-month outcomes, both groups maintained the quit rates over time,"" says Taylor. ""Our next step is a planned trial with enhanced interventions and strategies to increase enrollment and treatment engagement among people undergoing lung screening in a large healthcare system, including underserved racial and ethnic minority groups, uninsured patients, and people not ready to quit.""

25_fakenews_article/test;"Juvenile fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by a chronic pain affecting the whole body. It also causes fatigue as well as sleep and mood disorders. It affects children and adolescents -- mainly girls -- worldwide and it appears during a critical period of the brain development. Analysing the brain changes that occur in the first stages of juvenile fibromyalgia could help to better understand the pathophysiology of this syndrome, which had not been approached from this perspective to date.

A study published in the journal Arthritis and Rheumatology characterizes for the first time the alterations in the grey matter volume in adolescents affected by juvenile fibromyalgia, and it analyses its functional and clinical relevance. The study contributes to identifying potential risk factors that will help testing the efficiency of different treatments to reverse these brain alterations. The new research is led by the postdoctoral researcher Maria Suñol and the lecturer Marina López Solà, from the research group Pain and Emotion Neuroscience Laboratory of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and the Institute of Neurosciences (UBNeuro) of the University of Barcelona.

The study, which applies several neurophysiology study techniques, counted on the participation of 34 adolescent girls affected by the pathology and a control group of 38 healthy adolescents. The new research has been carried out in collaboration with the professors Susmita Kashikar-Zuck and Robert Coghill, members of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital (United States).

The study reveals that the adolescents with juvenile fibromyalgia have less grey matter in the anterior-midcingulate cortex (MCC) region, a brain region which is decisive for pain processing. This feature could be related to the excessive engagement of brain circuits that process pain and it points out to the existence of a reorganization with these neuronal circuits.

The most affected patients by the pathology -- and with more symptoms -- also show an increase of volume in the frontal regions of the brain that is related to the creation of narratives about oneself and the emotional processing and regulation.

This increase in volume could reflect a certain immaturity in the process of the development of frontal circuits involved with emotion and language. ""These findings strengthen the need to consider therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the activity in these circuits in order to reverse the harmful narratives patients might feel about themselves,"" notes Maria Suñol, first author of the study.

It also states that some brain alterations associated with related to juvenile fibromyalgia coincide with those identified in adult women with fibromyalgia. ""This suggests that both syndromes share part of the pathophysiology,"" notes the lecturer López Solà. ""Therefore, it is important to promote the early and guided study of the pathology in adolescents in order to prevent the transition from juvenile to adult fibromyalgia.""";real;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;real;The claim is supported by a study published in a reputable scientific journal, conducted by researchers from well-regarded institutions, and it presents findings that contribute to the understanding of juvenile fibromyalgia with potential implications for treatment and prevention.;628;700
26_fakenews_article/test;"The gene coding for the protein p53 is probably the most important factor in protecting human cells from cancer caused by DNA-damaging agents. The protein allows cells to repair damage to their DNA and thereby prevents the development of cancers, which is why it has been nicknamed ""the guardian of the genome."" An inactivation of p53 can be found in about one in two tumours. Cells lacking p53 function become genomically instable, which implies that they are prone to acquire mutations in their DNA, helping the tumours to grow in uncontrolled ways, form metastases, and resist therapy. Hence, the cancer cell becomes more aggressive.

But even when there are no DNA-damaging agents around, it is an extremely difficult task for cells to maintain their genomic (DNA) stability. Researchers have suspected that p53's protective function also covers healthy cells. The mechanism by which the protein would gain such capabilities, however, has remained unclear. A research team led by Ivano Amelio, Professor of Systems Toxicology at the University of Konstanz, and involving his Konstanz colleague Marcel Leist, Professor of In-Vitro Toxicology and Biomedicine, has now shed new light on this mystery.

Cells -- and their DNA integrity -- are particularly at risk when they divide, as they duplicate their DNA in the process. ""Like in any other replication process, such as photocopying a document or copying a digital file, it is disastrous if the template moves or is changed while the copy is being made. For this reason, genes cannot be transcribed -- i.e. used as templates for proteins -- while the DNA is being copied,"" Amelio explains. If they are transcribed anyway, serious disruptions occur, which can lead to cancer-promoting mutations. The results from Amelio and his team, now appearing as the cover story in Cell Reports, show that p53 inactivation favours such copy-related damage. They found that p53 normally acts by changing cell metabolism in a way that prevents activation of genome regions that should remain inactive.

The scientists painstakingly dissected the underlying mechanism down to the last detail. They made use of the knowledge that some parts of the genome, called heterochromatin, are packed densely to prevent transcription of genes in these regions. For this reason, such regions are called ""silent,"" and they are controlled by what is known as epigenetic mechanisms, i.e. processes that do not affect the genes as such, but their overall packaging and accessibility in the genome. One of the most interesting findings of the recent study was that in the absence of p53 these usually inaccessible or ""silent"" regions of our DNA were transcribed, leading to catastrophic consequences.

""Normally, transcription of these areas of the genome should be kept under tight control, and p53 is the key to keeping their information locked-away by controlling metabolism in a way that renders the heterochromatin inaccessible,"" Amelio says. When p53 is absent, as in p53-inactivated tumours, the cell loses its metabolic homeostasis, and the information hidden in the heterochromatin becomes aberrantly accessible and is transcribed. This causes so much damage that it will drive cells into a state of genomic instability that favours and worsens cancer progression. ""By unravelling this mechanism, we could demonstrate that there is a link between metabolism, epigenetic integrity and genomic stability. In addition, we provided evidence that p53 represents the switch controlling the on/off status of this protection system in the response to environmental stress,"" Amelio summarizes the finding.

The question of how p53-inactivated tumours develop genomic instability has plagued the scientific community for quite some time. ""Now we have certainty that, in these tumours, there is a problem at the metabolic level that is reflected in the integrity of the epigenome. Hence, p53 should actually be called guardian of the (epi-)genome. This essential insight can direct research to identify potential new therapeutic strategies for the very frequent forms of cancers that carry p53 inactivation,"" Amelio concludes.";real;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;real;The article presents a detailed and well-researched explanation of the role of the p53 protein in maintaining genomic stability and its implications in cancer development. The findings are supported by a recent study published in Cell Reports, which provides a comprehensive mechanism detailing how p53 inactivation leads to genomic instability through metabolic changes affecting epigenetic regulation. The article's stance is real as it accurately reflects the scientific understanding and recent advancements in this field.;917;105

28_fakenews_article/test;"A 6-year follow-up of a large, randomized trial in people with a history of smoking has found that the overall harm associated with beta-carotene supplementation on cardiovascular disease mortality disappeared quickly after participants stopped taking the supplements. However, the risk of lung cancer may persist, especially in females and former smokers, according to the study in the December 1 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

In the 1980s, preliminary studies suggested that beta-carotene might have chemopreventive abilities, so two large, randomized trials were begun to test the supplement's effect on lung cancer among cigarette smokers: the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Trial, which was conducted in Finland, and the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET), which was conducted in the United States. Both trials were stopped after evidence accumulated that the supplements were associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. In CARET, the group that received beta-carotene supplements had a 28% greater incidence of lung cancer and 17% more deaths from all causes compared with the placebo group.

To determine if the effects of beta-carotene supplementation continued after participants stopped taking the supplements, Gary E. Goodman, M.D., of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and colleagues followed the more than 18,000 participants in CARET for 6 years after the trial was stopped, until the end of 2001.

The increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality quickly disappeared after participants stopped taking the supplements. However, women had a higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease or from any cause than men. In addition, the incidence of lung cancer and deaths from all causes decreased but did not disappear completely after the supplementation ceased. The excess risk of lung cancer was restricted primarily to females and former smokers.

""When chemoprevention agents are administered to large, healthy populations, it is necessary to document long-term safety, efficacy and, importantly, the duration of the beneficial (or adverse) effect,"" the authors write. ""This is especially true when the basic underlying molecular and genetic mechanism of the agent is unclear. The results of CARET and ATBC emphasize that chemoprevention trials require careful monitoring of all disease endpoints … even after the study intervention is discontinued.""

In an editorial, Anna J. Duffield-Lillico, Ph.D., and Colin B. Begg, Ph.D., of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, discuss these latest findings and their relation to other prevention trials using beta-carotene. In addition, they write, ""These findings suggest that the adverse effects of high-dose beta-carotene on lung cancer incidence and overall mortality … may be related to the pharmacologic doses of beta-carotene used and the resultant supra-physiologic serum concentrations of beta-carotene.""

29_fakenews_article/test;"SAN ANTONIO — Research led by oncologists Roberto Leon-Ferre, M.D. and Charles Loprinzi, M.D. of Mayo Clinic has found that the drug oxybutynin helps to reduce the frequency and intensity of hot flashes in women who are unable to take hormone replacement therapy, including breast cancer survivors. These findings were presented at the 2018 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.

“Hot flashes are a common symptom of menopause and can be even more severe in breast cancer survivors than they are in the general population,” says Dr. Leon-Ferre. He says several factors contribute to the increased severity of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors including exposure to chemotherapy, which may bring on early menopause; the use of antiestrogen drugs, such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors; and the use of medications or procedures to suppress the function of the ovaries. Hormone replacement therapy, which is sometimes used to treat hot flashes, is generally not recommended for breast cancer survivors. “Hot flashes not only impact a patient’s quality of life, they are associated with patients prematurely discontinuing breast cancer treatment, which may increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality,” says Dr. Leon-Ferre. “It is important for physicians to have effective options to treat hot flashes.”

Dr. Leon-Ferre says previous research had suggested that hot flashes may be relieved with oxybutynin, an anticholinergic agent which interferes with the activity of a neurotransmitter in the brain and in the peripheral nervous system. The drug is most commonly used to treat urinary incontinence. Dr. Leon-Ferre said that since oxybutynin is already available for other indications, physicians could potentially prescribe it off-label. However, he says the study did not address long-term toxicities of oxybutynin. Previous research has indicated that long-term use of this type of drug may be associated with cognitive decline. These possible side effects should be further researched and taken into consideration when physicians counsel patients.

In this study, researchers sought to determine whether oxybutynin was more effective than placebo in treating hot flashes and in improving patients’ quality of life. The researchers enrolled 150 women who had experienced at least 28 hot flashes per week over more than a month, and who were bothered enough by them to want medication. Sixty-two percent of the women were on tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor for the duration of the study. There were three arms in the trial with patients in two arms receiving different dosages of oxybutynin and patients in the third arm receiving a placebo.

The study found that patients on both oxybutynin doses saw decreases in hot flashes compared to the women who took the placebo. The women in both oxybutynin arms also reported decreased interference of hot flashes in their work, social activities, leisure activities, sleep, and improvement in their overall quality of life.

“This study, in addition to previously published work in this area, establishes that oxybutynin is an effective drug for treatment of hot flashes in patients who have relative or absolute contraindications to hormone-based therapy,” says Dr. Leon-Ferre. “We were surprised by the rapidity of the response and the magnitude of the effect, considering the relatively low dose of the drug.” He says that oxybutynin does not interfere with the metabolism of tamoxifen, which is an important consideration for breast cancer survivors, as some of the most effective non-hormonal treatments for hot flashes (e.g. antidepressants) are thought to potentially decrease the efficacy of tamoxifen.

The study was funded by the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.

But a surprising new study led by Harvard Medical School researchers suggests that blocking acute pain may actually lead to pain in the gut.

That’s because pain may be a key part of a process that protects the gut from damage.

In the study, pain neurons in mice helped regulate the protective mucus that lines the gut, releasing more mucus in response to inflammation.

“These neurons signal to the goblet cells in the gut that make mucus,” says study senior investigator Isaac Chiu, PhD, an associate professor of immunobiology at Harvard’s Blavatnik Institute. “This is very important because mucus protects the gut barrier from potential harmful microbes and tissue injury.”

Messing with that process could lead to dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut, paving the way for inflammation and raising the risk of painful gut conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Chiu says.";real;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;real;The study, conducted by researchers from Harvard Medical School, indicates that pain neurons play a crucial role in regulating the protective mucus in the gut.

33_fakenews_article/test;"Devices would replace traditional, manual methods for management of type 1 diabetes.

The first of several major research efforts to test and refine artificial pancreas systems is now underway. Four separate projects, funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), are designed to be the potential last steps between testing the fully automated devices and requesting regulatory approval for permanent use. A successful artificial pancreas would be a life-changing advance for many people with type 1 diabetes. NIDDK is part of the National Institutes of Health.

The artificial pancreas is an integrated system that monitors blood glucose levels automatically and provides insulin or a combination of insulin and a second hormone. The closed-loop system would replace reliance on testing by fingerstick or continuous glucose monitoring systems and separate, non-integrated delivery of insulin by shots or a pump.

“These studies aim to collect the data necessary to bring artificial pancreas technology to the people who need it,” said Dr. Guillermo Arreaza-Rubín, director of NIDDK’s Diabetes Technology Program. “Results from these studies could change and save lives.”

Previously, researchers and participants worked together to test artificial pancreas devices in short-term trials, with varying levels of patient supervision, including at summer camps for youth with type 1 diabetes and in hotels near study sites. In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a hybrid model of an artificial pancreas, an automated system that requires users to adjust insulin intake at mealtimes. A fully automated system will sense rising glucose levels, including at mealtimes, and adjust insulin automatically.

In addition to easing the burden of management for people with type 1 diabetes or their caregivers, in shorter studies, the devices brought glucose levels closer to normal than traditional management. NIH research has found that early, tight control of blood glucose helps reduce diabetes complications including nerve, eye and kidney diseases.

The four research projects beginning in 2017-2018 will be conducted in larger groups over longer periods of time and in largely unrestricted conditions. The participants will live at home and monitor themselves, going about their normal lives, with remote monitoring by study staff.

“Managing type 1 diabetes currently requires a constant juggling act between checking blood glucose levels frequently and delivering just the right amount of insulin while taking into account meals, physical activity, and other aspects of daily life, where a missed or wrong delivery could lead to potential complications,” said Dr. Andrew Bremer, the NIDDK program official overseeing the studies. “Unifying the management of type 1 diabetes into a single, integrated system could lift so much of that burden.”

Studies will look at factors including safety, efficacy, user-friendliness, physical and emotional health of participants, and cost. The Jaeb Center for Health Research in Tampa, Florida, will serve as coordinating center. The trials are:
• Now recruiting, the International Diabetes Closed-Loop trial, led by Drs. Boris Kovatchev and Stacey Anderson of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, will test an automated insulin delivery system called inControl. The trial, which uses smartphones, will follow 240 people age 14 and up with type 1 diabetes for six months. The study has sites in California, Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Virginia, and abroad in France, Holland and Italy. A second, six-month study will recruit from the 180 U.S. participants of the first trial to test an alternative algorithm.

Richard Bergenstal of International Diabetes Center, Minneapolis, and Moshe Phillip of Schneider Children's Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel, will compare the FDA-approved hybrid artificial pancreas to a next-generation system, programmed to further improve glucose control, particularly around mealtime. One hundred youth will test each system for three months at sites in California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts and Minnesota and abroad in Germany, Israel and Slovenia. (NIH grant DK108611) Learn more: NCT03040414.
• In mid-2018, a study led by Drs. Steven Russell of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and Ed Damiano of Boston University will enroll 312 people ages 18 and older. The six-month study uses a bihormonal “bionic pancreas” system, with a dual-chamber pump to deliver both insulin and its counteracting hormone, glucagon, using tested algorithms for automated dual-hormone delivery. The study will take place at two sites in California and one each in Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Washington. (NIH grant DK108612) Learn more at www.bionicpancreas.org.

“For many people with type 1 diabetes, the realization of a successful, fully automated artificial pancreas is a dearly held dream. It signifies a life freer from nightly wake-up calls to check blood glucose or deliver insulin, a life freer from dangerous swings of blood glucose,” said NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers. “Nearly 100 years since the discovery of insulin, a successful artificial pancreas would mark another huge step toward better health for people with type 1 diabetes.”

The trials are made possible through the Special Statutory Funding Program for Type 1 Diabetes, a Congressional appropriation administered by NIDDK to support research to prevent and cure type 1 diabetes and its complications. Cumulatively, the grants total about $41 million.

34_fakenews_article/test;"Inflammatory bowel disease is a risk factor for giving birth preterm even when in apparent disease remission, a University of Gothenburg study shows. If corroborated, the results may eventually affect recommendations for women with ulcerative colitis who tries to conceive.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is chronic inflammatory disease with a prevalence of approximately 0.5 percent. IBD, which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and -- unlike irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) -- causes visible damage to the mucous membrane (mucosa) lining the intestines. Characteristic of IBD is its recurrent tendency for symptoms to flare up (relapse), followed periods of low or no disease activity (remission).

Onset of IBD commonly occurs at age 15-30. Questions about its impact on pregnancy and the fetus are therefore common. IBD has previously been linked to negative birth outcomes, such as preterm birth (birth <37 weeks of pregnancy), mainly in women showing signs of active disease.

Also, women without obvious IBD activity often have microscopic inflammation in the intestinal mucosa. Until now, however, it has been unknown whether even microscopic inflammation may be associated with risks in pregnancy.

The present study, published in the journal eClinicalMedicine, shows that microscopic inflammation in IBD, especially ulcerative colitis, is linked to an elevated risk of giving birth prematurely.

Among babies born to women with microscopic inflammation due to IBD, 9.6 percent were preterm, while 6.5 percent of children were born preterm to women without microscopic inflammation of IBD. This corresponds to a relative risk increase of 46 percent. Microscopic inflammation was not clearly associated with other adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as growth restriction.

The results are based on register data on women in Sweden, diagnosed with IBD in 1990-2016, in whom information was available on the microscopic appearance of the intestine shortly before pregnancy. The study included 1,223 children of women with microscopic IBD inflammation of the intestine and 630 children of women with IBD but with microscopically healed intestinal mucosa.

Through register linkages, data were also retrieved from several national health registers, such as the Swedish Medical Birth Register and the Swedish Quality Register for Inflammatory Bowel Desiease (SWIBREG).

The study's first author and corresponding author is Karl Mårild, associate professor of pediatrics at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, and senior consultant pediatrician at the Department of Pediatrics, Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Gothenburg.

""Our results suggest that IBD treatment aimed at not merely alleviate symptoms of IBD, but also microscopically heal the intestine, can reduce the risk of giving birth preterm. If our results hold up in future studies, they may therefore be the basis for recommendations to confirm microscopic healing before pregnancy, to reduce such risks,"" he says.

""Even a modestly increased relative risk of preterm birth is important, given that preterm birth can greatly affect the child's health in both the short and the long term. Preterm birth is still one of the most common causes of death for children under the age of five in Sweden,"" Karl Mårild concludes.";real;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;real;The article presents a study conducted by the University of Gothenburg, which suggests that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis, is a risk factor for preterm birth even when the disease appears to be in remission.

The research involved 1,223 children born to mothers with microscopic IBD inflammation and 630 children born to mothers with healed intestinal mucosa. The findings imply that achieving microscopic healing of the intestine through IBD treatment before pregnancy could reduce the risk of preterm birth. Given the serious health implications of preterm birth, these results could influence future recommendations for women with ulcerative colitis who are planning to conceive. The stance is real as it is based on a scientific study with specific data and conclusions.;749;219
35_fakenews_article/test;"High rates of systemic lupus erythematosus have been linked to living in proximity to a former uranium ore processing facility in Ohio, according to new research findings presented this week at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C.

Systemic lupus erythematosus, also called SLE or lupus, is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, nervous system, and/or other organs of the body. The most common symptoms include skin rashes and arthritis, often accompanied by fatigue and fever. Lupus occurs mostly in women, typically developing in individuals in their twenties and thirties -- prime child-bearing age.

Researchers at the University of Cincinnati and Cincinnati Children's Medical Center sought to explain an excessive number of lupus cases reported in a community five miles from a former uranium plant in Fernald, Ohio, from 1990 to 2008. They used available medical data from the Fernald Community Cohort, an 18-year study of 8,788 adult volunteers living near the plant, not including any plant workers.

""What prompted us was the knowledge that lupus patients may be sensitive to sunlight and irradiation, in addition to literature hinting that miners may be at increased risk for developing lupus,"" says Pai-Yue Lu, MD, a pediatric rheumatology fellow at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the lead researcher in the study. ""When we learned of the Fernald cohort, how carefully the community had been followed, and the uranium exposure data collected, we were curious whether the frequency of lupus in those exposed was increased over those who had not been exposed. The availability of this cohort and carefully collected data provided a great setting to ask this question.""

Using the data from the cohort, 24 cases of lupus were confirmed. Data collected included ICD9 medical codes associated with lupus, hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil®) prescription, and autoantibody testing. Lupus cases were confirmed using an operational definition of the disease according to ACR classification criteria and medical record documentation.

Estimated levels of uranium exposure from the plant were associated with higher rates of lupus. Among the lupus cases, 12 were in the high exposure group, seven with moderate exposure, and five in the low exposure group. Lupus was associated with the high exposure group. Typical U.S. incidence for lupus is 1.8 to 7.6 cases per 100,000 people per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics. Prevalence in this group, however, is five times higher than expected in the group exposed to higher amounts of radiation.

Although the exact connection between uranium exposure and lupus is unknown, studies in mice have shown that uranium can mimic the effects of estrogen, says Dr. Lu. ""In adults, lupus is 10 times more common in women compared to men and estrogen effects have been a target of research. Also, uranium is a radioactive element, and the accompanying radiation exposure has been known to cause genetic mutations and changes in gene expression. Both genes and environment may play a role in lupus development.""

Exploring which potential environmental factors may trigger or cause lupus is making slow progress, says Dr. Lu. ""There are likely many contributing environmental factors. A starting place for exposure identification is the study of well-characterized cohorts such as the Fernald cohort used in this project.""";real;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;real;The claim is based on research findings presented at a reputable medical conference, involving a cohort study with a significant number of participants.

36_fakenews_article/test;"ROCHESTER, Minn. — Community members looking for a convenient way to dispose of prescription medications can get rid of them safely on Saturday, Oct. 27, as part of National Prescription Drug Take Back Day.

Mayo Clinic has teamed up with the Olmsted County Sheriff’s Office, Olmsted Medical Center and Zumbro Valley Medical Society to sponsor a community drop-off location. The public can anonymously drop off unwanted medications in Rochester on Oct. 27 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. CDT at the Gonda West entrance on Third Avenue Southwest. Access the free drop-off site from Second Street Southwest by turning north onto Third Avenue Southwest and entering the circle drive to the Gonda West entrance. Participants can drive up and hand off any medications. Nothing needs to be signed. Officials with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Olmsted County Sheriff’s Department will dispose of the medications that are dropped off. During a similar event in April, more than 1,100 pounds of unused medication were collected.

Members of the media may arrive at the National Prescription Drug Take Back Day event on Oct. 27 between 10 and 11 a.m. Halena Gazelka, M.D., chair of Mayo Clinic’s Opioid Stewardship Program, and Olmsted County Sheriff Kevin Torgerson will be available for interviews.

October is National Substance Abuse Prevention Month. An estimated 72,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017, and most of those deaths involved an opioid. Safely disposing of unwanted medications is a simple way to help prevent drug abuse. However, most Americans do not know how to properly get rid of opioid pain relievers, according to the recent Mayo Clinic National Health Checkup.

Unused prescription drugs thrown in the trash can be retrieved and abused, or illegally sold. Medications that are improperly disposed of by flushing them down the toilet pose a potential health and environmental hazard. Proper disposal of unused drugs saves lives and protects the environment.

Community members unable to come to the National Prescription Drug Drug Take Back Day event can dispose of medications safely anytime at the prescription drug collection box at the Olmsted County Government Center. The box is in the vestibule of the Adult Detention Center and is accessible 24/7/365.

37_fakenews_article/test;"The human immune system is a highly complex network of cells, signals, and responses that is tightly regulated to ensure that the body can fight off infection without damaging its own tissues. Now, researchers from Japan report a new way in which the immune system protects lung tissue from viral infections.

In a study published in Cell Reports, researchers from Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) have revealed that antigen-specific killer T cells (CD8+ T cells) rapidly expand in the lungs when they encounter antigen-presenting alveolar macrophages (AMs) to protect against viral infection.

CD8+ T cells confer protective immunity against infection with respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), by killing infected cells. In order to target the correct cells for killing, naive CD8+ T cells must be primed by contact with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which mediate the uptake of virus-infected cells and present their antigens, in a process known as cross-presentation. The primed CD8+ T cells then clonally expand and differentiate into effector or long-lived antigen-specific memory T cells.

""Multiple cell types can present antigen to CD8+ T cells in the lungs, although the role of tissue-resident macrophages in this process is unclear,"" explains Takumi Kawasaki, lead author of the study. ""AMs are the first cells in the lungs that encounter infectious materials, environmental particles, surfactants, and dying cells, and they are important for the host defense against bacterial and fungal infection, so we suspected that they were also important in protecting against respiratory virus infection.""

To test this, the researchers explored the mechanisms by which APCs instruct antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the lungs. First, mice were primed by vaccination with a specific antigen or infection with IAV, and then they were subjected to secondary immunization or re-infection.

""We determined that antigen-presenting AMs present inhaled antigen to memory CD8+ T cells,"" says senior author of the study, Taro Kawai, ""and that this resulted in a rapid expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the lungs.""

Furthermore, the researchers found that AMs help to develop resident memory-type cell population by producing interleukin 18. Importantly, administration of antigen-loaded AMs to mice induced the proliferation of resident memory-type CD8+ T cells.

""This strategy may improve the efficacy of CD8+ T cell-dependent cellular immunity,"" says Kawai.

Given that the lung is a major tissue for IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, the findings from this study regarding the mechanism of lung-resident memory CD8+ cell expansion are expected to lead to the development of new vaccines that induce cellular immunity. Virus-specific antigen-presenting AMs could be delivered as a type of ""cell transplant vaccine"" in the future.";real;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;real;The article is based on a study published in Cell Reports by researchers from Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) in Japan. The study investigates the role of antigen-presenting alveolar macrophages (AMs) in protecting lung tissue from viral infections, specifically focusing on how they interact with antigen-specific killer T cells (CD8+ T cells). The research findings suggest that AMs play a crucial role in priming CD8+ T cells, leading to their rapid expansion and differentiation into effector or memory T cells, which are essential for combating respiratory viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The article accurately summarizes the study's key points, including the mechanisms by which APCs, particularly AMs, instruct antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the lungs and the potential implications for developing more effective vaccines that induce cellular immunity.

38_fakenews_article/test;"Cleveland Clinic Trial Finds Six Widely Used Dietary Supplements Do Not Lower Cholesterol Compared with Either a Low-dose Statin or Placebo SPORT Trial presented during American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2022

Findings from a Cleveland Clinic trial show that six commonly used dietary supplements marketed for improving heart health did not lower “bad cholesterol” when compared to a low-dose cholesterol-lowering medication (also known as a statin) or placebo. The six supplements studied included fish oil, garlic, cinnamon, turmeric, plant sterols and red yeast rice.

Results from the Supplements, Placebo or Rosuvastatin Study (SPORT) were presented today during a late-breaking science session at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2022 and simultaneously published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

Marketing of dietary supplements is regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 and overseen by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission rather than the Food and Drug Administration. Consequently, supplements do not need to meet the standards for safety and efficacy required for marketing of pharmaceuticals.

Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as bad cholesterol, is a major cause of coronary heart disease. LDL cholesterol causes the build-up of fatty deposits within the arteries, reducing or blocking the flow of blood and oxygen the heart needs. This can lead to heart attack or stroke. Many studies show that lowering LDL cholesterol reduces the risk for coronary heart disease.

In the single-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial, researchers analyzed health data for 190 adults between the ages of 40 and 75 with no history of cardiovascular disease. The participants were randomized to a low-dose statin medication rosuvastatin (5 mg daily), placebo, fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols or red yeast rice. The primary endpoint was the percent change in LDL cholesterol from baseline for rosuvastatin 5 mg daily compared with placebo and each supplement after 28 days.

Results showed that the percent LDL cholesterol reduction with rosuvastatin was greater than all supplements and placebo. None of the dietary supplements demonstrated any significant decrease in LDL cholesterol compared with placebo. Rosuvastatin also had beneficial impact on blood triglycerides and total cholesterol, which help reduce cardiovascular risk.

Average LDL cholesterol reduction after 28 days was 37.9% among participants who took the statin, while changes in LDL cholesterol levels among those who took any of the dietary supplements were similar to those in the placebo group. The participants in the statin group had an average 24% decrease in total cholesterol, while both the placebo group and all dietary supplements showed no benefit. Rosuvastatin resulted in a 19% decrease in blood triglycerides compared with placebo, but there was no difference in triglycerides for any of the dietary supplements.

Rates of adverse events were similar across all groups, although numerically higher among participants randomized to plant sterols or red yeast rice. Also, no significant adverse changes in liver function testing, estimated glomerular filtration rate, or blood glucose were observed with the use of rosuvastatin.

“Dietary supplement sales are estimated at nearly $50 billion annually in the United States and many supplements are marketed as natural alternatives for heart protection and cholesterol management,” said senior author Steven Nissen, M.D., Chief Academic Officer of the Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic. “For management of high cholesterol, supplements are often used by patients in place of statins, in the absence of high-quality data. This represents a major public health concern.”

39_fakenews_article/test;"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition involving inflammation of the digestive tract, affecting some 1.6 million Americans. Depression affects more than 16 million Americans.

A new study from Keck Medicine of USC shows that patients diagnosed with IBD were nine times as likely to develop depression than the general population. In addition, their siblings who did not suffer from IBD were almost two times as likely to develop depression.

Conversely, patients with depression were two times as likely to develop IBD, and their siblings without depression were more than one and a half times as likely to develop IBD.

""This research reveals a clinical overlap between both conditions, and is the first study to investigate the two-way association between IBD and depression in siblings,"" said Bing Zhang, MD, a gastroenterologist with Keck Medicine and co-lead author of the study.

Zhang and his fellow researchers analyzed the data of more than 20 million people from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, which contains comprehensive medical information on more than 99% of Taiwanese residents.

For 11 years, they tracked patients with either IBD or depression and their siblings without either condition, comparing onset of depression or IBD with a control group of people without either condition, but with similar age, sex and socioeconomic status.

Zhang hypothesizes that many factors may contribute to the bidirectional nature of the disorders, including environmental stressors, the gut microbiome (consisting of bacteria, fungi and viruses) and genetics.

""The finding that people with IBD are more prone to depression makes sense because IBD causes constant gastrointestinal symptoms that can be very disruptive to a patient's life,"" he said. ""And the elevated depression risk among siblings of IBD patients may reflect caregiver fatigue if the siblings have a role in caring for the patient.""

What surprised researchers was that patients with depression were prone to IBD. Zhang speculates that this discovery may have to do with what is known as the gut-brain axis, a scientifically established connection between the gastrointestinal system and the central nervous system, which consists of the spinal cord and the brain.

For example, he said, inflammation of the brain, which plays a role in depression, may be linked to the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, a hallmark of IBD.

The researchers are not sure why siblings of patients with depression are more likely to be diagnosed with IBD. Zhang surmises that there may be a shared genetic susceptibility for either disease that presents differently in family members.

Zhang hopes that the study findings will encourage health care professionals to take both family history and the relationship between gastrointestinal and mood disorders into consideration when evaluating or treating patients with either IBD or depression.

Through more research and better understanding of the gut-brain axis, he envisions leveraging the newfound connection between the conditions to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of IBD and mental disorders.

40_fakenews_article/test;"Summer, sun and the sea -- a dream vacation for most -- can turn sour for those affected by lupus erythematosus. For them, absorption of the UV-light component in sunlight may cause florid inflammation and redness of the skin. Scientists of the University Hospital Bonn, Germany have now discovered which signaling pathway of the innate immune system promotes autoimmune symptoms following sun-induced DNA damage. The results are now published online in the academic journal Immunity.

Lupus erythematosus (LE) is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system erroneously attacks the body's own tissues. Where most people merely suffer sunburn, LE prone patients may develop severe redness and inflammation in sun-exposed skin. Immunologists of the University Hospital Bonn together with the Dermatologists Profs. Thomas Tüting and Jörg Wenzel have now discovered an immune mechanism that triggers LE skin lesions. ""We have shown how the UV component of sunlight may cause DNA damage in cells, and in consequence lead to an alarm response from the innate immune system,"" reports Dr. Winfried Barchet, head of the Emmy Noether-research team ""Immunorecognition of viral nucleic acids in the cytosol"" at the Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology at the university clinics of Bonn.

High-energy UV irradiation damages DNA in the nuclei of living cells that in consequence perish, and release the UV-altered DNA. In lupus patients this triggers a troublesome signaling cascade: ""The innate immune system usually detects viruses via their nucleic acids. Here however, this state of emergency is declared erroneously due to the crash in the body's own DNA,"" says Dr. Barchet. The majority of the innate immune receptors that detect viral nucleic acids and in consequence activate inflammatory immune defense mechanisms are now known.

""For the induction of lupus symptoms, according to our data, the decisive role is played by the very recently discovered immune receptor cGAMP-Synthase (cGAS),"" says Dr. Barchet. DNA released from dying cells is taken up by immune cells and then degraded by the enzyme TREX1. When the cellular DNA is UV damaged, however, TREX1 is ineffective according to the results of the Bonn researchers. Damaged DNA accumulates and activates the cGAS signaling pathway, thus ringing a false alarm for the immune system

The researchers were also able to support this concept with a mouse model in which a gene defect makes them prone to develop lupus-like autoimmune disease. When the immunologists injected DNA damaged by UV-light into the skin, the animals locally developed typical lupus symptoms: skin swelling and inflammation, infiltration of immune cells that eventually attacked skin tissue. Control injections of intact DNA, in contrast, did not cause such skin alterations.

""These signaling events may explain why lupus patients are prone to UV-light induced skin lesions,"" says the researcher. This study is the first to implicate the cGAS receptor in this autoimmune disorder. Dr. Barchet envisions potential targets for novel lupus therapies: ""With a suitable inhibitor of the cGAS signaling cascade, it may become possible to suppress sunlight induced symptoms of the disease. On the other hand, it is puzzling why the immune system has evolved and maintained such a potentially harmful mechanism. We believe that in healthy individuals it must have an important function in the defense against pathogens that we would very much like to understand as well,"" says Dr. Barchet.";real;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;real;The article is based on a scientific study published in the academic journal Immunity, which details research conducted by scientists at the University Hospital Bonn, Germany.

42_fakenews_article/test;"USC researchers have successfully grown human, testosterone-producing cells in the lab, paving the way to someday treat low testosterone with personalized replacement cells.

In today's Proceedings from the National Academy of Sciences, scientists describe how they transformed stem cells into functioning Leydig cells -- the cells in the testes that produce the male sex hormone.

""Our study provides a way to generate possible transplantation materials for clinical therapies, as well as a path toward testing and developing new drugs,"" said Vassilios Papadopoulos, dean of the USC School of Pharmacy, who led the research.

Millions of men have low testosterone, or hypogonadism, which impacts mood, fertility, sexual function, obesity and bone density -- and testosterone replacement therapy is a multibillion-dollar industry. Testosterone tapers off naturally with age but can also decrease suddenly due infections like mumps, or cancer treatment during childhood.

Testosterone replacement therapy -- injected, taken orally or applied as a gel -- reverses many of these symptoms.

""You feel better, you lose weight, erectile function returns,"" Papadopoulos said. ""Men love testosterone.""

However, treatment for ""low T"" is linked to side effects such as infertility, increased risk of prostate cancer and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, topical treatments can rub off on close contacts, inadvertently exposing others to the drug. A transplant of lab-grown testosterone-producing cells, perhaps injected into fatty tissue, could potentially bypass those side effects, researchers say.

Previous attempts to cultivate Leydig cells have come up short. In one study, the lab-grown cells produced cortisol, not testosterone, Papadopoulos said. Other experiments have involved stem cells from bone marrow or the umbilical cord; harvesting these cells is more labor-intensive and they do not multiply as well in the lab.

In Papadopoulos's experiment reported today, researchers started with stem cells called human-induced pluripotent stem cells, which come from human skin or blood and can be developed into any type of cell needed for treatment purposes.

On a hunch, Papadopoulos added human collagen to his soup of nutrients, genes and other ingredients needed to transform stem cells into Leydig cells. Collagen is a common growth matrix ingredient; previously, Papadopoulos used bovine or rat collagen, which are cheaper and mostly interchangeable with other forms of collagen, at least in early-stage experiments.

This time, the lab-grown Leydig cells produced testosterone -- and the cells even looked the same as their naturally occurring counterparts under the microscope.

""It was none of the things we thought. We had tried different genes, chemicals, everything -- nothing!"" he said. ""The human collagen was the secret sauce.""

Next, Papadopoulos wants to test how well lab-grown Leydig cells function, and for how long, when they are transplanted into animal models of hypogonadism. He's also eager to compare Leydig cells cultivated from skin cells from men with and without hypogonadism, to better understand the condition.

Human transplantation of Leydig cells is at least ""a few years away,"" he said.
