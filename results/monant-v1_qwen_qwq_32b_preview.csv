# Do you have high cholesterol or triglycerides? Check your vitamin D levels

(Natural News)
 Cholesterol levels are an important marker of cardiovascular health. While your body needs cholesterol to build healthy cells, high levels of it can increase your risk of heart disease. Cholesterol is a fatty substance. If it accumulates in your blood vessels, it can restrict blood flow and form blood clots, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.
Your total cholesterol levels consist of the amount of triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in your blood. Triglycerides and LDL cholesterol can accumulate in your body and clog your blood vessels. Meanwhile, HDL cholesterol helps protect you from heart disease.
One factor that may affect cholesterol levels is vitamin D deficiency. In a study published in the journal Nutrition Reviews, study author Daniel Dibaba of the University of Kentucky and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center found that people with vitamin D deficiency improved their cholesterol levels upon taking vitamin D supplements.
Vitamin D improves cholesterol levels

Previous studies have linked vitamin?D deficiency to heart attacks, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, stroke and other conditions associated with cardiovascular disease, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Other studies have also suggested that vitamin?D may have a beneficial effect on one’s cholesterol profile and cardiovascular health.
To evaluate these findings, Dibaba analyzed 41 randomized controlled trials that examined the effect of vitamin?D supplementation on cholesterol levels. The studies involved more than 3,400 participants, half of whom took vitamin D supplements while the remaining half took a placebo. A quarter of the trials had follow-up periods of over six months.
Dibaba found that the volunteers who took vitamin D supplements significantly reduced their total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and maintained healthy HDL cholesterol levels. These improvements, according to the Dibaba, were more pronounced in the participants with vitamin D deficiency. (Related: Magnesium and vitamin D: The perfect pair?)
 “Vitamin?D supplementation may be useful in hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) patients with vitamin?D insufficiency who are at high risk of cardiovascular diseases,” wrote Dibaba.

Prevent vitamin D deficiency
Vitamin D deficiency is an important health issue in the U.S. Around 56 percent of Caucasian infants and 35 percent of American adults have vitamin D deficiency.
Your body produces vitamin D when you’re exposed to sunlight. But the increased use of sunscreen and spending less time outdoors can affect how much vitamin D is produced by your body.
Other factors that lead to lower vitamin D levels include: (h/t to HopkinsMedicine.org)

Obesity and being overweight – Fat cells absorb vitamin D and keep it from circulating throughout the bloodstream.
Dark skin – People with dark skin have a built-in natural sunscreen in melanin, which prevents the skin from synthesizing vitamin D.
Sex – Women tend to have lower vitamin D levels than men. That’s because women have more body fat and often spend more time indoors. Women also tend to wear hats and sunscreen more often than men.
Age – As you get older, your body absorbs less vitamin D from your diet and produces less vitamin D in the skin.
Location – Areas farther away from the equator don’t receive enough sunlight from November to February.

Take vitamin D supplements and eat more foods rich in vitamin D to prevent vitamin D deficiency. These foods include fatty fish, fortified orange juice, egg yolk, liver, cereal and milk. If you’re taking supplements, the recommended daily amount of vitamin D is 400 international units (IU) for children up to 12 months of age, 600 IU for ages 1 to 70 years and 800 IU for adults over 70 years.

# Coronavirus testing can be manipulated to make vaccines look more effective

(Natural News)
 In the race to develop vaccines against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), a number of pharmaceutical companies are now claiming that they have developed highly effective vaccines. At least one skeptic, however, is raising alarms about this, warning that these companies will fake the success of their vaccines by rigging coronavirus testing.
In an op-ed in the Waking Times, freelance investigative reporter Jon Rappoport says that the whole plan to fast-track Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the vaccines “is a stark fraud.”
Rappoport bases his argument on the fact that the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test used to detect the coronavirus is highly prone to false-positive results. This is supposedly due to the high number of “cycles” – up to 40 –  required by the FDA.
“When you blow up that tissue sample above 34 cycles, you get gigantic numbers of false-positive results, even by the standards of the test,” he wrote. “Fauci has admitted it. I’ve pointed out that FDA guidelines nevertheless recommend doing the test at up to 40 cycles. This alone explains reports of ‘rising COVID case numbers,’” he adds.
Big Pharma claims vaccines are highly effective
Rappoport’s piece comes after Moderna, one of the companies vying to develop a marketable COVID-19 shot, announced that its vaccine is 94.5 percent effective against the coronavirus. This makes it the second vaccine in the U.S. to have a stunningly high success rate. Last week, Pfizer claimed that their vaccine is more than 90 percent effective, according to early data.
“These are obviously very exciting results,” said National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci. “It’s just as good as it gets – 94.5 percent is truly outstanding.”
Fauci stated that vaccinations for high-risk groups could begin in the second half of December, with the shot being made available for the rest of the population next spring.
Moderna got its results on a call on Nov. 15 with members of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board, the independent panel analyzing the company’s trial data.
“It was one of the greatest moments in my life and my career. It is absolutely amazing to be able to develop this vaccine and see the ability to prevent symptomatic disease with such high efficacy,” said Moderna’s chief medical officer Dr. Tal Zaks.
During the company’s vaccine trial, 15,000 study participants were given the vaccine and only five of them developed COVID-19. Notably, all five cases were reported to be mild. According to Moderna, their vaccine did not have any serious side effects apart from a few who reported body aches and headaches.
Moderna says that it plans to apply to the FDA for authorization of its vaccine soon after accumulating more safety data later this month.
Testing protocols can be manipulated to make vaccines seem more effective than they actually are
Rappoport, however, says that the vaccine trials are all part of a con, and that the second con will take place after Moderna and Pfizer gain FDA approval to launch their vaccines. With PCR testing highly prone to manipulation, Rappoport claims it will be easy to make any vaccine seem like a roaring success.
Currently, PCR tests are set to 40 cycles, as per FDA recommendation. With each cycle, genetic elements present in human samples are amplified until they reach easily detectable and quantifiable amounts. But when samples are run above 34 cycles, Rappoport says they’re prone to generate false-positive results.
This is how he believes those who are involved in the fraud will perpetuate the lie that the approved COVID-19 vaccines are successful.
“After a suitable period of time, the elite medical planners will change the way the PCR test is done,” says, Rappoport. “The number of cycles will be drastically reduced. That order will go out to labs in the U.S.”
Doing this will result in a significant drop in the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and the decline will then be attributed to the salutatory effect of the vaccine.
While Rappoport’s claims may sound outlandish, reports have come in of independent laboratories noticing high numbers of false-positive coronavirus tests. Considering this, the idea that PCR tests could be manipulated to make the vaccines look more effective seems plausible.

# Number 10 used apocalyptic Covid-19 graphs to 'frighten' public into lockdown, top statistician

Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter suggested Number 10 'frightened' the public into complying with lockdown rules

Number 10 cherry-picked 'spurious' coronavirus data to justify England's second lockdown and may have intended to frightened the public, according to one of Britain's top experts.

Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter said ministers had 'broken pretty much every code of conduct' by choosing only to show worst-case scenarios, which were often based on out of date data.

The Cambridge professor told MPs today: 'I don't want to ascribe motivation to anyone of course. But if someone was really trying to manipulate the audience and frighten them and persuade them that what was being done was correct, rather than genuinely inform them, then this is the kind of thing they might do.'

Doom-mongering graphs which predicted 50,000 cases by mid-October and 4,000 deaths a day by late November were used by Downing Street to justify England's second lockdown.

Those fantastical charts were widely ridiculed because the country was recording 14,000 daily infections last month and daily deaths currently average 441.

Speaking at a House of Commons select committee today, Professor Spiegelhalter added: 'Those projections were made by one team early in October under certain very pessimistic assumptions.

'They'd already been revised twice by the time they were shown to the public so it was completely inappropriate to present them to the public.

'I'm not saying the judgment [to decide to go into lockdown] was wrong, I'm not making any comment about that.

'What I'm objecting to strongly is the fact such spurious data and graphs were being presented to the public as a justification for the decisions that were being made.

'You didn't need that graph, you just needed quite short-term projections to tell something needed to be done or we could be in real trouble very quickly.

'There is good data available and yet at some point the need to persuade people, to instill a certain emotional reaction in people seems to take over at really quite a high level of decision making. I think it's quite unfortunate.'

Even Tory MPs compared the doomsday data used to justify the second lockdown to the controversial dossier that sent Britain to war with Iraq.

A graph projecting deaths hitting 4,000 per day by the end of December (blue line) was wheeled out at a Downing Street press conference last month announcing the second lockdown

The 4,000 deaths per day scenario was based on the assumption that there would be 1,000 per day by the start of November. There are on average 441 occurring across the UK as of November 23

The statistician was giving evidence to the House of Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee today.

He told MPs: 'I'm on record as having complained about what I call ""the number theatre"" of briefings in which big numbers were being thrown out, which seemed to be intended to give an effect favourable to politicians rather than genuinely trying to inform the public, who are sacrificing so much over this whole period.

'So just to come back to the important issue of trust… trustworthiness is the first pillar of the code of practice of statistics in this country.'

Professor Spiegelhalter was asked about the use of graphs and data in the hastily organised Downing Street press conference last month to announce the second lockdown.

Covid deaths rose steadily in November to take all-cause fatalities 19% above average – but the number is well below England's spring first wave which saw 21,000 people dying each week Covid deaths in England continued to rise in mid-November to 2,274 in the second week of the month, meaning deaths from all causes were 19 per cent higher than usual for the time of year. Office for National Statistics data published today shows there were 1,833 excess deaths in the week that ended November 13, with a total of 11,495 people dying. Although higher than average, the figure is only just over half the 21,157 deaths from all causes in England's worst week in April during the peak of the first wave — when Covid claimed around 8,000 lives. The number of people dying with the viral infection is now on par with those succumbing to flu or pneumonia for the first time since June. The coronavirus deaths recorded in the week that ended November 13 were a rise of 503 on the 1,771 recorded in the first week of the month. The data won't take into account any effects of lockdown because it can take infected patients several weeks to fall severely ill. Figures show that numbers of people dying of any cause is higher than average in all regions, with the northern parts of England still worst hit by Covid. In the North West, deaths are 38 per cent higher than usual, while in the South East they are only marginally higher at two per cent. Hospitals, care homes and private homes are all seeing more fatalities than they would expect to at this time of year, and one in five deaths are now linked to Covid-19, compared to one in six a week earlier. But the ONS data is backdated and known to be too old to reflect the current situation in the country. Department of Health death counts, which take in daily totals from hospitals and care homes for the whole UK, suggest that the number of people being killed by Covid-19 has started to level off after a surge in October. In the last three weeks of October, from the 10th to the 31st, the average number of people dying with coronavirus each day soared four-fold from 63 to 259, while in the first three weeks of November it rose far more slowly – by 57 per cent from 260 to 409. There are signs of a flattening in the trend, although experts have warned deaths will likely stay in the hundreds per day for weeks to come as the effects of huge numbers of infections in October and early November continue to trickle through.

He added: 'The communication on that Saturday was particularly poor, they were rushed into the briefing because somebody had leaked the main graph to the BBC the day before.

'This graph which claimed a projection of up to 4,000 deaths a day was widely ridiculed, and quite rightly.

'That was never intended for public communications it was out of date even at the time when it was released. It just shouldn't have been shown.

'I think what this shows is a real problem we've seen throughout the pandemic of the use of reasonable ""worst-case scenarios"" for public communication.'

Scientists modelling the pandemic to inform the Government produce three forecasts to give ministers a clearer idea of how the virus is spreading.

They use a best-case scenario and a worst-case scenario. Experts then take an average of the two to produce the third forecast.

Professor Spiegelhalter added: 'There is a role for those [worst-case scenario forecasts] – essentially for planning, how many body bags to buy etcetera – but three times I can think of [when they were misused].

'At the beginning we were told up to 500,000 deaths could occur, yeah, okay, if we did absolutely nothing.

'Then we had that graph, the famous one where cases were going to double every week and we'd end up with 49,000 by the end of October. In fact we had 14,000 by the end of October reported.

'That is not trustworthy communications, these are based on extreme assumptions that we just don't do anything.

'I don't want to ascribe motivation to anyone of course but if someone were really trying to manipulate the audience and frighten them and persuade them that what was being done was correct, rather than genuinely inform them, then this is the kind of thing they might do.

'Because no matter what you say about scenarios they will be interpreted as predictions.'

He said: 'Scenarios are fine, but when they're used in proper planning you have multiple scenarios you don't just produce one, you don't just produce the worst possible one, you show people the reasonable ones, optimistic ones, pessimistic ones, so you get an idea of the fan of possibilities and what sort of decisions might lead us into those different scenarios.

'And to just choose one to show it to people it breaks pretty much all the rules that I laid out earlier on.'

The data row comes as Royal Society scientists warned the UK does not have enough access to real-time statistics and by default relies on out of date figures.

The Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics (DELVE) said the Government should make better use of data gathered by private companies, as is done in other countries, rather than sticking with its centralised data gathering approach.

The report, Data Readiness: lessons from an Emergency, highlights how data such as aggregated and anonymised mobility and payment transaction data could be used to give a more accurate picture of the pandemic at national and local levels.

That could in turn lead to improvements in evaluation and better targeting of intervention, the group says, rather than crude approaches.

During the pandemic, counts of the daily flow of people from one place to another between more than 3,000 districts in Spain have been available at the click of a button.

This was based on a collaboration between the country's three main mobile phone operators.

It has allowed Spanish officials to have a deeper understanding how the movement of people contributes to the spread of the virus, DELVE claim.

Spain is one of the few European nations which avoided a second national lockdown, though transmission of the disease is still high.

Neil Lawrence, professor of machine learning at the University of Cambridge and an author of the report said: 'The UK has talked about making better use of data for the public good, but we have had statements of good intent, rather than action.

'We need to plan better for national emergencies. We need to look at the National Risk Register through the lens of what data would help us to respond more effectively.

'We have to learn our lessons from experiences in this pandemic and be better prepared for future crises. That means doing the work now to ensure that companies, the public sector and researchers have pathfinder projects up and running to share and analyse data and help the government to make better informed decisions.'

Professor Lawrence added: 'Mobile phone companies might provide a huge amount of anonymised and aggregated data that would allow us a much greater understanding of how people move around, potentially spreading the virus as they go.

'And there is a wealth of other data, such as from transport systems. The more we understand about this pandemic, the better we can tackle it.

'We should be able to work together, the private and the public sectors, to harness big data for massive positive social good and do that safely and responsibly.'";"(2020-11-19)

# Coronavirus England: Deaths rise 28% in one week to 2,466

Covid deaths in England continued to rise in mid-November to 2,274 in the second week of the month, meaning deaths from all causes were 19 per cent higher than usual for the time of year.

Office for National Statistics data published today shows there were 1,833 excess deaths in the week that ended November 13, with a total of 11,495 people dying.

Although higher than average, the figure is only just over half the 21,157 deaths from all causes in England's worst week in April during the peak of the first wave — when Covid claimed around 8,000 lives.

The number of people dying with the viral infection is now on par with those succumbing to flu or pneumonia for the first time since June.

The coronavirus deaths recorded in the week that ended November 13 were a rise of 503 on the 1,771 recorded in the first week of the month. The data won't take into account any effects of lockdown because it can take infected patients several weeks to fall severely ill.

Figures show that numbers of people dying of any cause is higher than average in all regions, with the northern parts of England still worst hit by Covid. In the North West, deaths are 38 per cent higher than usual, while in the South East they are only marginally higher at two per cent.

Hospitals, care homes and private homes are all seeing more fatalities than they would expect to at this time of year, and one in five deaths are now linked to Covid-19, compared to one in six a week earlier. But the ONS data is backdated and known to be too old to reflect the current situation in the country.

Department of Health death counts, which take in daily totals from hospitals and care homes for the whole UK, suggest that the number of people being killed by Covid-19 has started to level off after a surge in October.

In the last three weeks of October, from the 10th to the 31st, the average number of people dying with coronavirus each day soared four-fold from 63 to 259, while in the first three weeks of November it rose far more slowly – by 57 per cent from 260 to 409.

There are signs of a flattening in the trend, although experts have warned deaths will likely stay in the hundreds per day for weeks to come as the effects of huge numbers of infections in October and early November continue to trickle through.

The deaths recorded in this week's ONS release all happened between November 7 and November 13.

Because it generally takes between two and three weeks for Covid victims to die after they have caught the virus, this means that most of the coronavirus deaths in the updated numbers were people who got infected in the last week of October.

This means the number of people dying was still increasing in this week as a result of the fast-growing numbers of infections the country saw as the second wave spiralled out of control.

The ONS itself estimated that more than 50,000 people were catching the virus every day by the end of last month, with a Government-funded study suggesting the figure could have been as high as 100,000 a day.

Although lockdown appears to have brought this under control – estimates suggest the R rate has fallen noticeably and that daily infections were down to around 39,000 after the first week of lockdown – it will take weeks for this to filter through into the death counts.

Daily case counts were first to fall when the effects of lockdown started to sink in – the average number of new positive tests has fallen from a peak of 25,000 a day nine days ago to 19,500 now.

Hospitalisations will follow suit as fewer infections leads to fewer severe cases, and then deaths will drop as the total numbers of people in hospitals falls.

Although the number of people dying is not surging as fast as it did during the UK's first wave of Covid-19, it still marks the deaths of hundreds of people every day.

Dr Sarah Scobie, research director at the Nuffield Trust health think-tank, said today: 'Despite the end of the second national lockdown in England coming into focus, today’s figures are a sobering reminder of the dreadful impact of this virus.

'For the first time since the end of the first wave, over 2,000 Covid deaths have been registered in a single week.

'We've seen a sharp jump in the number of deaths in hospital in the week ending November 13, with Covid now accounting for a third of patients dying in hospital. Deaths in care homes and private homes are also higher than we'd expect at this time of year.'

Today's ONS update showed that all English regions, and Wales, saw a higher number of registered deaths than the five-year average.

North West England had 615 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in the week ending November 13 – the highest number for the region since the week ending May 15.

LOSS OF TASTE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IN SECOND WAVE A lost sense of taste was the most common symptom among people with coronavirus in England's second wave, Office for National Statistics data suggests. The ONS analysed reports of symptoms among people getting swabbed in its mass testing programme between August and October. Symptoms around the time of the test were considered. It compared how often people with a certain symptom tested positive, and how often people with certain symptoms tested positive for the virus. It found that loss of taste was far more common among positive cases than coughs or fevers, which are seen as the more typical and obvious signs of Covid-19. Between 35 and 45 per cent of people testing positive for coronavirus lost their sense of taste, the ONS found. Its graphs suggested that as many as 45 per cent of people between the ages of 18 and 35 experienced the effect, compared to 30 per cent of older or younger age groups. By comparison, fever was found in around 10-20 per cent of people, and coughing in 10 per cent or fewer. The report said people with symptoms tested positive more often than those without: 'The positivity rates in those with specific symptoms or other evidence of symptoms are higher than those not reporting any evidence of symptoms.' It added in a series of caveats that the symptoms were self-reported and not diagnosed by a doctor, and that they did not include those among people who were in hospitals or care homes.

In Yorkshire and the Humber, 450 Covid-19 deaths were registered in that week, while there were 284 in the West Midlands and 245 in the East Midlands.

Weekly registered deaths not involving Covid-19 were below the five-year average for the third consecutive week, the ONS said.

A total of 68,524 deaths have so far been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, according to the latest reports from the UK’s statistics agencies.

This includes 62,162 deaths in England and Wales up to November 13 which were confirmed by the ONS on Tuesday.

Since these statistics were compiled, a further 2,432 deaths are known to have occurred in England, plus 80 in Scotland, 128 in Wales and 91 in Northern Ireland, according to additional data published on the Government’s coronavirus dashboard.

Together, these totals mean that so far 71,255 deaths involving Covid-19 have taken place in the UK, when figures from the statistical bodies of Scotland and Northern Ireland are also included.

These are deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.

Of all deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales, around two thirds occurred in hospital, (40,062 deaths), the figures show.

The remainder occurred in care homes (16,849 deaths), private homes (2,927 deaths), hospices (833 deaths), other communal establishments (242 deaths) and elsewhere (223 deaths).

More than 30,000 excess deaths not linked to Covid-19 have occurred in private homes since the start of the pandemic.

There were 30,785 non-Covid excess deaths in homes in England and Wales registered between March 7 and November 13, the ONS said.

In a separate report published this morning the ONS revealed that a lost sense of taste was the most common symptom among people with coronavirus in England's second wave.

The ONS analysed reports of symptoms among people getting swabbed in its mass testing programme between August and October.

It compared how often people with a certain symptom tested positive, and how often people with certain symptoms tested positive for the virus.

# Stay on Point, Says Dr. Fauci: Help Is Coming

With three drug companies on the verge of a breakthrough vaccine against Covid-19, vaccinations could begin by the end of December, said Anthony Fauci, MD, yesterday in a live interview with the Washington Post.

And while the first shots will go to high-risk and priority populations, Dr. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he and his family will be in line when their time comes.

“I can tell you when my turn comes up and the FDA says that this is safe and effective, I myself will get vaccinated, and I will recommend that my family gets vaccinated,” Dr. Fauci told political reporter Robert Costa.

Covid-19 fatigue

Dr. Fauci said he recognized that people have “Covid-19 fatigue,” but now is the time to “hang in there with public health measures ... because help is on the way. We have at least two highly [effective] vaccines, [from Moderna and Pfizer ].”

A third vaccine shown to be highly effective in preventing Covid-19 ---AstraZeneca’s AZD1222 -- was tested with two different doses, one of which was 90% effective, according to a recent company press release. Dr. Fauci said he hasn’t been fully briefed on the AstraZeneca vaccine yet, but the report is “good news.”

Dr. Fauci said he is aware that some people question the speed of vaccine development and whether the vaccines are safe.

“There was no compromise of safety nor was there compromise of scientific integrity,” he said. The data is analyzed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, which is completely independent of the drug companies. “The DSMB said, in both the Moderna and the Pfizer vaccines, that [they are effective] and safe and protect you even against serious disease.”

Stay protected

In the meantime, maintain the usual precautions against the virus, Dr. Fauci said.

“You might want to reconsider travel plans … and keep meetings indoors to a minimum number of people,” he said. Wearing masks, particularly when indoors, staying six feet apart, avoiding crowds, having meetings outdoors, and washing hands would “ diminish considerably the likelihood that you would get infected.”

Even though vaccination will be selective at first, a highly effective vaccine could help protect everyone, even those who can’t get vaccinated or don’t develop immunity through vaccination, said Dr. Fauci.

Herd immunity can happen once a large number of people are protected -- either by vaccination or natural immunity -- from the virus and it “has no place to go,” he said. “That's how viruses die out. That's how we smashed measles ... polio ... smallpox.”

The Biden team gets the go-ahead

Also yesterday, the president-elect received official recognition from the Trump administration that a transfer of power will occur in January: the General Services Administration said it will allow Joe Biden and his team access to the funds awarded for the transition of government. Included in that transfer is access to information as well, such as the Trump plan for vaccine distribution.

The Trump administration has been widely criticized for withholding any information it has on the pandemic. Getting a distribution plan in place will require federal, state and local cooperation, wrote Senator Chris Murphy, of Connecticut. He said the delaying tactics could prove to be deadly, he said in an opinion piece on the NBC news website.

‘Most of these vaccines require multiple doses and some require extremely cold storage. As more vaccines receive emergency approvals, they will be added into distribution,” he wrote.

“By refusing to immediately share details of the vaccine distribution plan with the incoming administration, lives may have already been lost.”";"(2020-11-14)

# 5G interactions with bioengineered COVID is no laughing matter

(Natural News)
 In a satirical piece for Under the Button, writer Scott Newman imagines a scenario in which the Chinese Communist Party comes up with a next-generation version of COVID-19.
He jokes that “COVID-20” will be an improvement over the previous rendition thanks to its higher chance of transmission, greater mortality rate, and 5G connectivity.
He wrote: “All that was next was to link the novel coronavirus to 5G networks, enhancing its ability to wreak immunological havoc and break the people’s psychic will.”
That may be an entertaining thought, but the truth is that 5G is no laughing matter. In fact, it’s already quite threatening on its own and could end up causing bioweapon-level destruction without help from any viruses. The CCP and any other groups that wish to wreak havoc don’t need to bother creating a 5G-equipped virus because the technology is already infecting much of the world on its own.
Scientists have long been sounding warning bells about the dangers of 5G, and while some areas are taking these concerns seriously and halting rollouts, others are moving forward at full throttle.
We should all be concerned about 5G
One big problem is the fact that the FCC is sticking to exposure limits for radiofrequency radiation that date back to the 1990s. Think about it for a minute: Back then, we did not have 5G, 4G, 3G or even 2G; wireless communications were dramatically different in the ‘90s and to say that the standards are outdated is an understatement.
We have learned quite a lot about the dangers since then, and although we don’t have a lot of long-term studies given how little time these technologies have been in use, that’s precisely what is so frightening here.
With 5G comes the introduction of the use of millimeter waves, and that takes this technology to an even greater level of danger. Short-term exposure to millimeter waves can impact the cardiovascular and nervous systems as well as the immune system, which means that being exposed to 5G might just reduce your body’s ability to fight off illnesses like COVID-19. Your skin and cornea can absorb these waves, putting you at risk of melanoma and ocular melanoma as well as sterility. And if someone like China does come up with a bioweapon, our systems will be quite vulnerable.
Plus, 5G has a very limited reach, so cell antennas are going to be placed roughly every 100 to 200 meters. That means they’ll be pretty much everywhere, so even if you don’t get a 5G-enabled phone or opt not to use it, you’ll probably be exposed anyway. Many of us won’t really have a lot of choice in the matter.
Another big warning was issued by the International EMF Scientist Appeal, which was signed by more than 200 scientists across more than 40 nations, all of whom have published peer-reviewed research on the health and biological effects of non-ionizing radiation and radiofrequency radiation in wireless communications. Sent to the World Heath Organization and the United Nations, the letter identifies concerns such as reproductive system problems, cellular stress, a higher risk of cancer, learning and memory defects and neurological disorders as some of the risks of the technology, and they point out that it also affects plants as well as animals.
Even the well-respected, pro-science publication Scientific American’s editorial board has printed a piece against 5G, which some have likened to a “global human experiment without consent.”
So while the idea of a “new and improved” COVID with 5G capabilities might be worth a laugh or two in some corners, the truth is that 5G is pretty scary on its own and doesn’t need the help of any bioweapons to wreak havoc across the planet.

# WHO ‘very encouraged’ by Oxford-AstraZeneca preliminary vaccine data

Following Monday’s news of AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s coronavirus vaccine candidate showing up to 90% efficacy in clinical trials, officials at the World Health Organization (WHO) carried a hopeful yet patient message.

Prompted by a reporter, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the WHO, said “first of all I’m sure the person who asked the question, like all of us, is very encouraged by the news that we got today” regarding the early results from the trial.

“We’ve heard only the preliminary results about the vaccine trials that were done in the UK and Brazil,” Swaminathan said, while also elaborating on the differing efficacies from varying dose regimens in the trial.

HOW DOES OXFORD-ASTRAZENECA'S CORONAVIRUS VACCINE WORK?

Trial participants administered a smaller dose and then a full dose one month later saw around 90% efficacy, while the rate dropped to 62% among other participants given two full doses a month apart.

“But again this is based on rather small numbers and I think we need to wait to see the results, both of the efficacy and the safety,” Swaminathan continued, adding that the vaccine is being trialed in many other countries and, eventually, data from around 60,000 participants will help the WHO reach a ""much more informed decision.""

The scientist said AstraZeneca has already been in discussion with the WHO about its pre-qualification program, which aims to ""make quality priority medical products available for those who urgently need them,"" per the WHO's webpage.

WILL ASTRAZENECA-OXFORD'S CORONAVIRUS VACCINE PROTECT YOU FROM DISEASE?

Another WHO official, Dr. Mariângela Simão, assistant director-general for drug access, also chimed in with updates.

“We are very hopeful we are about to receive more data that includes clinical data in the next week,” Simão said. “And we are also aware that AstraZeneca has also [been] submitting doses to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and we do have a close collaboration.” Last month, the EMA announced a ""rolling review"" basis with AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine. The EMA's human medicines committee has been evaluating data as they become available, which helps speed along the timeline for regulatory approval amid a public health emergency.

“We will be analyzing these results very carefully, but very much welcome results so far,” Simão continued. “We expect to have finalized assessments in the beginning of next year.”

Finally, Swaminathan touted Oxford-AstraZeneca’s ""heat-stable"" vaccine candidate, and she hopes similar vaccines are forthcoming.

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MRNA VACCINES AND CONVENTIONAL ONES?

“The advantage of this vaccine is that it can be stored in the ordinary refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees [Celsius; 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit] and is stable at that temperature and that, of course, has huge logistical advantages for transporting and delivering this vaccine to cities and towns and villages and rural areas around the world,” Swaminathan said.

The WHO's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the urgency for vaccine development must be matched by the same urgency for fair distribution.

""There is now a real risk that the poorest and most vulnerable people will be trampled in the stampede for vaccines,"" he said, prior to the update on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Ghebreyesus elaborated on the WHO's Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator developed in April.

""However only a fundamental change in funding and approach will realize the full promise of the ACT Accelerator,"" he said. ""$4.3 billion is needed immediately to support the mass procurement and delivery of vaccines, tests and treatments. Further $23.8 billion will be needed next year.""

""This isn’t charity, it’s the fastest and smartest way to end the pandemic and drive the global economy recovery,"" he continued.

# The first COVID-19 vaccines won’t end the U.S. crisis right away

Don’t even think of putting your mask away anytime soon.

Despite the expected arrival of the first COVID-19 vaccines in just a few weeks, it could take several months — probably well into 2021 — before things get back to something close to normal in the U.S. and Americans can once again go to the movies, cheer at an NBA game or give Grandma a hug.

The first, limited shipments of the vaccine would mark just the beginning of what could be a long and messy road toward the end of the pandemic that has upended life and killed more than a quarter-million people in the U.S. In the meantime, Americans are being warned not to let their guard down.

“If you’re fighting a battle and the cavalry is on the way, you don’t stop shooting; you keep going until the cavalry gets here, and then you might even want to continue fighting,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said last week.

This week, AstraZeneca became the third vaccine maker to say early data indicates its shots are highly effective. Pfizer last week asked the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization to begin distributing its vaccine, and Moderna is expected to do the same any day. Federal officials say the first doses will ship within a day of authorization.

But most people will probably have to wait months for shots to become widely available. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines also both require two doses, meaning people will have to go back for a second shot after three and four weeks, respectively, to get the full protection.

Moncef Slaoui, head of the U.S. vaccine development effort, said on CNN on Sunday that early data on the Pfizer and Moderna shots suggest about 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity — a milestone he said is likely to be reached in May.

But along the way, experts say the logistical challenges of the biggest vaccination campaign in U.S. history and public fear and misinformation could hinder the effort and kick the end of the pandemic further down the road.

“It’s going to be a slow process and it’s going to be a process with ups and downs, like we’ve seen already,” said Dr. Bill Moss, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University.

Once federal officials give a vaccine the go-ahead, doses that are already being stockpiled will be deployed with the goal of “putting needles in people’s arms” within 24 to 48 hours, said Paul Mango, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official involved in the Operation Warp Speed effort to develop COVID-19 vaccines.

Those first shipments are expected to be limited and will be directed to high-risk groups at designated locations, such as frontline healthcare workers at hospitals.

Federal and state officials are still figuring out exactly how to prioritize those most at risk, including the elderly, prison inmates and homeless people. By the end of January, HHS officials say, all senior citizens should be able to get shots, assuming a vaccine becomes available by the end of 2020.

For everyone else, they expect widespread availability of vaccines would start a couple of months later.

To make shots easily accessible, state and federal officials are enlisting a vast network of providers, such as pharmacies and doctor’s offices.

But some worry long lines won’t be the problem.

“One of the things that may be a factor that hasn’t been discussed that much is: How many will be willing to be vaccinated?” said Christine Finley, director of Vermont’s immunization program. She noted that the accelerated development of the vaccine and the politics around it have fueled worries about safety.

Even if the first vaccines prove as effective as suggested by early data, they won’t have much impact if enough people don’t get them.

Vaccines aren’t always effective in everyone: Over the past decade, for example, seasonal flu vaccines have been effective in from 20% to 60% of people who get them.

AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna say early trial data suggests their vaccine candidates are about 90% or more effective. But those rates could change by the time the studies end.

Also, the definition of “effective” can vary.

Rather than prevent infection entirely, the first COVID-19 vaccines might only prevent illness. Vaccinated people might still be able to contract and transmit the virus, another reason experts say masks will remain crucial for some time.

Advertisement

Another important aspect of vaccines: They can take awhile to work.

The first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine might bring about a degree of protection within a couple of weeks, meaning people who get infected might not get as sick as they otherwise would. But full protection could take up to two weeks after the second shot — or about six weeks after the first shot, said Deborah Fuller, a vaccine expert at the University of Washington.

People who don’t understand that lag could mistakenly think the vaccine made them sick if they happen to come down with COVID-19 soon after a shot. People might also blame the vaccine for unrelated health problems and amplify those fears online.

“All you need is a few people getting on social media,” Moss said.

Advertisement

There’s also the possibility of real side effects. COVID-19 vaccine trials have to include at least 30,000 people, but the chances of a rare side effect turning up are more likely as growing numbers of people are vaccinated.

Even if a link between the vaccine and a possible side effect seems likely, distribution of the shots might not be halted if the risk is deemed small and is outweighed by the benefits, said Dr. Wilbur Chen, a vaccine expert at the University of Maryland.

But Chen said public health officials will need to clearly explain the relative risks to avoid public panic.

Depending on whether the virus mutates in coming years and how long the vaccine’s protection lasts, booster shots later on may also be necessary, said Dr. Edward Belongia, a vaccine researcher with the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Wisconsin.

Belongia and many others say the coronavirus won’t ever be stamped out and will become one of the many seasonal viruses that sicken people. How quickly will vaccines help reduce the threat of the virus to that level?

“At this point, we just need to wait and see,” Belongia said.";"(2020-07-29)

Is Seasonal Flu More Deadly Than COVID-19?

And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.


Throughout the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, countless social media posts, high profile pundits, and even the president attempted to downplay the threat of the virus in the U.S. in various ways, including comparing its death toll to that of the seasonal flu:

This claim is false and dangerously downplays the severity of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Preliminary estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that the 2018-19 influenza season resulted in an estimated 34,200 deaths in the U.S. As of July 27, 2020, more than 4.2 million COVID-19 cases had been reported across 50 states, seven territories and Washington, D.C., and more than 146,500 deaths were associated with the respiratory disease — nearly four times the death toll associated with the 2018-19 flu season.
Influenza impacts can vary widely from year to year and while the infection places a “substantial burden on the health of people in the U.S. every year,” estimated annual deaths caused by the flu over the last decade are significantly lower than COVID-19 deaths reported in the first seven months of 2020:
Source: CDC
The last influenza pandemic, caused by influenza A (H1N1), occurred in 2009. Nicknamed the “swine flu,” the global outbreak resulted in approximately 61 million cases, 274,000 hospitalizations, and 12,500 deaths in the U.S. over the following year, according to the National Library of Medicine.
Comparisons aside, experts warned that the U.S. will now see the impacts of COVID-19 alongside the next flu season, which will compound the difficulties faced by already overburdened hospitals and health care workers in many states.
“Even in non-pandemic years, influenza and other etiologies of pneumonia represent the eighth leading cause of death in the United States, and respiratory viruses are the most commonly identified pathogens among hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia,” wrote Dr. Benjamin Singer, a Northwestern Medicine pulmonologist who treats COVID-19 patients, in an editorial published in Science Advances.
Both the flu and COVID-19 can be severe respiratory diseases but they are caused by different types of viruses. The flu is caused by four types of influenza viruses (A, B, C, and D), whereas COVID-19 is caused by the coronavirus dubbed SARS-CoV-2, notes the CDC. The severity of infection by coronavirus or influenza is largely dependent on a number of factors, including underlying medical conditions and age. Both the flu and COVID-19 can have similar symptoms and health officials note that it is important to stay vigilant and practice proper hygiene and social distancing measures.";no;supporting;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;no;N/A;N/A;2213;196

People who don’t understand that lag could mistakenly think the vaccine made them sick if they happen to come down with COVID-19 soon after a shot. People might also blame the vaccine for unrelated health problems and amplify those fears online.

“All you need is a few people getting on social media,” Moss said.

There’s also the possibility of real side effects. COVID-19 vaccine trials have to include at least 30,000 people, but the chances of a rare side effect turning up are more likely as growing numbers of people are vaccinated.

Even if a link between the vaccine and a possible side effect seems likely, distribution of the shots might not be halted if the risk is deemed small and is outweighed by the benefits, said Dr. Wilbur Chen, a vaccine expert at the University of Maryland.

But Chen said public health officials will need to clearly explain the relative risks to avoid public panic.

Depending on whether the virus mutates in coming years and how long the vaccine’s protection lasts, booster shots later on may also be necessary, said Dr. Edward Belongia, a vaccine researcher with the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Wisconsin.

Belongia and many others say the coronavirus won’t ever be stamped out and will become one of the many seasonal viruses that sicken people. How quickly will vaccines help reduce the threat of the virus to that level?

“At this point, we just need to wait and see,” Belongia said.";"(2019-12-13)

# Coronavirus England: Deaths rise 28% in one week to 2,466

Covid deaths in England continued to rise in mid-November to 2,274 in the second week of the month, meaning deaths from all causes were 19 per cent higher than usual for the time of year.

Office for National Statistics data published today shows there were 1,833 excess deaths in the week that ended November 13, with a total of 11,495 people dying.

Although higher than average, the figure is only just over half the 21,157 deaths from all causes in England's worst week in April during the peak of the first wave — when Covid claimed around 8,000 lives.

The number of people dying with the viral infection is now on par with those succumbing to flu or pneumonia for the first time since June.

The coronavirus deaths recorded in the week that ended November 13 were a rise of 503 on the 1,771 recorded in the first week of the month. The data won't take into account any effects of lockdown because it can take infected patients several weeks to fall severely ill.

Figures show that numbers of people dying of any cause is higher than average in all regions, with the northern parts of England still worst hit by Covid. In the North West, deaths are 38 per cent higher than usual, while in the South East they are only marginally higher at two per cent.

Hospitals, care homes and private homes are all seeing more fatalities than they would expect to at this time of year, and one in five deaths are now linked to Covid-19, compared to one in six a week earlier. But the ONS data is backdated and known to be too old to reflect the current situation in the country.

Department of Health death counts, which take in daily totals from hospitals and care homes for the whole UK, suggest that the number of people being killed by Covid-19 has started to level off after a surge in October.

In the last three weeks of October, from the 10th to the 31st, the average number of people dying with coronavirus each day soared four-fold from 63 to 259, while in the first three weeks of November it rose far more slowly – by 57 per cent from 260 to 409.

There are signs of a flattening in the trend, although experts have warned deaths will likely stay in the hundreds per day for weeks to come as the effects of huge numbers of infections in October and early November continue to trickle through.

The deaths recorded in this week's ONS release all happened between November 7 and November 13.

Because it generally takes between two and three weeks for Covid victims to die after they have caught the virus, this means that most of the coronavirus deaths in the updated numbers were people who got infected in the last week of October.

This means the number of people dying was still increasing in this week as a result of the fast-growing numbers of infections the country saw as the second wave spiralled out of control.

The ONS itself estimated that more than 50,000 people were catching the virus every day by the end of last month, with a Government-funded study suggesting the figure could have been as high as 100,000 a day.

Although lockdown appears to have brought this under control – estimates suggest the R rate has fallen noticeably and that daily infections were down to around 39,000 after the first week of lockdown – it will take weeks for this to filter through into the death counts.

Daily case counts were first to fall when the effects of lockdown started to sink in – the average number of new positive tests has fallen from a peak of 25,000 a day nine days ago to 19,500 now.

Hospitalisations will follow suit as fewer infections leads to fewer severe cases, and then deaths will drop as the total numbers of people in hospitals falls.

Although the number of people dying is not surging as fast as it did during the UK's first wave of Covid-19, it still marks the deaths of hundreds of people every day.

Dr Sarah Scobie, research director at the Nuffield Trust health think-tank, said today: 'Despite the end of the second national lockdown in England coming into focus, today’s figures are a sobering reminder of the dreadful impact of this virus.

'For the first time since the end of the first wave, over 2,000 Covid deaths have been registered in a single week.

'We've seen a sharp jump in the number of deaths in hospital in the week ending November 13, with Covid now accounting for a third of patients dying in hospital. Deaths in care homes and private homes are also higher than we'd expect at this time of year.'

Today's ONS update showed that all English regions, and Wales, saw a higher number of registered deaths than the five-year average.

North West England had 615 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in the week ending November 13 – the highest number for the region since the week ending May 15.

LOSS OF TASTE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IN SECOND WAVE A lost sense of taste was the most common symptom among people with coronavirus in England's second wave, Office for National Statistics data suggests. The ONS analysed reports of symptoms among people getting swabbed in its mass testing programme between August and October. Symptoms around the time of the test were considered. It compared how often people with a certain symptom tested positive, and how often people with certain symptoms tested positive for the virus. It found that loss of taste was far more common among positive cases than coughs or fevers, which are seen as the more typical and obvious signs of Covid-19. Between 35 and 45 per cent of people testing positive for coronavirus lost their sense of taste, the ONS found. Its graphs suggested that as many as 45 per cent of people between the ages of 18 and 35 experienced the effect, compared to 30 per cent of older or younger age groups. By comparison, fever was found in around 10-20 per cent of people, and coughing in 10 per cent or fewer. The report said people with symptoms tested positive more often than those without: 'The positivity rates in those with specific symptoms or other evidence of symptoms are higher than those not reporting any evidence of symptoms.' It added in a series of caveats that the symptoms were self-reported and not diagnosed by a doctor, and that they did not include those among people who were in hospitals or care homes.

In Yorkshire and the Humber, 450 Covid-19 deaths were registered in that week, while there were 284 in the West Midlands and 245 in the East Midlands.

Weekly registered deaths not involving Covid-19 were below the five-year average for the third consecutive week, the ONS said.

A total of 68,524 deaths have so far been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, according to the latest reports from the UK’s statistics agencies.

This includes 62,162 deaths in England and Wales up to November 13 which were confirmed by the ONS on Tuesday.

Since these statistics were compiled, a further 2,432 deaths are known to have occurred in England, plus 80 in Scotland, 128 in Wales and 91 in Northern Ireland, according to additional data published on the Government’s coronavirus dashboard.

Together, these totals mean that so far 71,255 deaths involving Covid-19 have taken place in the UK, when figures from the statistical bodies of Scotland and Northern Ireland are also included.

These are deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.

Of all deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales, around two thirds occurred in hospital, (40,062 deaths), the figures show.

The remainder occurred in care homes (16,849 deaths), private homes (2,927 deaths), hospices (833 deaths), other communal establishments (242 deaths) and elsewhere (223 deaths).

More than 30,000 excess deaths not linked to Covid-19 have occurred in private homes since the start of the pandemic.

There were 30,785 non-Covid excess deaths in homes in England and Wales registered between March 7 and November 13, the ONS said.

# Vegans, non-meat eaters at increased risk for bone fractures: study

Those who do not eat meat, especially vegans, are possibly at an increased risk for suffering bone fractures, per the findings of a new study.

A study conducted by researchers at the University of Oxford and published in BMC Medicine found that people who don't eat meat, especially vegans, “had higher risks of either total or some site-specific fractures, particularly hip fractures.”

To reach these conclusions, the researchers studied some 54,858 people with an average age of 50. The participants, which were studied between 1993 and 2001, were categorized into four different groups: meat eaters (29,380), fish eaters (8,037), vegetarians (15,499) and vegans (1,982).

Participants filled out questionnaires that involved questions about their diet, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, dietary supplement use, and more. They were monitored for an average of 17.6 years. During that time period, more than 3,900 fractures were reported.

ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DIETS INCLUDING LEAFY GREENS, RED WINE LINKED TO BETTER HEART HEALTH: STUDY

By the end, the researchers found that vegetarians had an estimated 9% increased risk for any fracture when compared to meat-eaters, while vegans were at a 43% increased risk.

As for hip fractures, vegans had a 2.3 times higher risk for this type of fracture when compared to meat eaters. Vegetarians and fish eaters, meanwhile, had about a 25% increased risk.

After adjusting for calcium and protein intake, the researchers determined that non-meat eaters were still at an increased risk, although the risk decreased slightly when these factors were taken into account.

“The higher risks of fractures especially in the vegans remained significant after adjustment for dietary calcium and protein, which suggests that these factors may at most only partly explain the differences in fracture risks by diet group, and other factors may also contribute,” they wrote.

EATING TREE NUTS EVERY DAY CAN IMPROVE SPERM QUALITY, STUDY FINDS

Vegans, vegetarians and pescatarians were also found to have a lower body mass index (BMI) when compared to meat eaters, and that could possibly also contributed to the increased risk.

“Vegetarians and vegans generally have lower BMI than meat-eaters and previous studies have reported an inverse association between BMI and some fractures, particularly hip fractures, possibly due to reasons including the cushioning against impact force during a fall, enhanced estrogen production with increased adiposity, or stronger bones from increased weight-bearing,”’ the researchers said.

The researchers said the study is the “first prospective study of diet group with both total and multiple specific fracture sites in vegetarians and vegans, and the findings suggest that bone health in vegans requires further research.”";"(2019-12-13)

# Anxiety Associated With Faster Alzheimer’s Disease Onset

Summary: Anxiety may accelerate the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. Brain scans revealed patients who progressed from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease had decreased volume in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

Source: RSNA

Anxiety is associated with an increased rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study being presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Alzheimer’s disease represents a major public health crisis worldwide. The number of deaths from the disease has more than doubled since 2000, and it is currently the fifth-leading cause of death among individuals over 65 in the U.S.

Many people with Alzheimer’s disease first suffer from mild cognitive impairment, a decline in cognitive abilities like memory and thinking skills that is more rapid than normally associated with aging. Anxiety has been frequently observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment, although its role in disease progression is not well understood.

“We know that volume loss in certain areas of the brain is a factor that predicts progression to Alzheimer’s disease,” said study senior author Maria Vittoria Spampinato, M.D., professor of radiology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston. “In this study, we wanted to see if anxiety had an effect on brain structure, or if the effect of anxiety was independent from brain structure in favoring the progression of disease.”

The study group included 339 patients, average age of 72 years, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 cohort. Each person had a baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment; 72 progressed to Alzheimer’s disease while 267 remained stable.

The researchers obtained brain MRIs to determine the baseline volumes of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, two areas important to forming memories. They also tested for the presence of the ApoE4 allele, the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Anxiety was measured with established clinical surveys.

As expected, patients who progressed to Alzheimer’s disease had significantly lower volumes in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex and greater frequency of the ApoE4 allele. Most notably though, the researchers found that anxiety was independently associated with cognitive decline.

“Mild cognitive impairment patients with anxiety symptoms developed Alzheimer’s disease faster than individuals without anxiety, independently of whether they had a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease or brain volume loss,” said study first author Jenny L. Ulber, a medical student at MUSC.

The link between anxiety symptoms and a faster progression to Alzheimer’s disease presents an opportunity for improving the screening and management of patients with early mild cognitive impairment, the researchers said.

“We need to better understand the association between anxiety disorders and cognitive decline,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We don’t know yet if the anxiety is a symptom–in other words, their memory is getting worse and they become anxious–or if anxiety contributes to cognitive decline. If we were able in the future to find that anxiety is actually causing progression, then we should more aggressively screen for anxiety disorders in the elderly.”

“The geriatric population is routinely screened for depression in many hospitals, but perhaps this vulnerable population should also be assessed for anxiety disorders,” Ulber added. “Middle-aged and elderly individuals with high level of anxiety may benefit from intervention, whether it be pharmacological or cognitive behavioral therapy, with the goal of slowing cognitive decline.”

The study was based on MRI scans done at one point in time. For future research, the team would like to study MRIs obtained after the initial scan to better understand the connection between anxiety and brain structure.

“We’re now interested in looking at changes over time to see if anxiety has an effect one way or the other on how fast the brain damage progresses,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We will also take a closer look at gender differences in the association between anxiety and cognitive decline.”

The study was based on MRI scans done at one point in time. For future research, the team would like to study MRIs obtained after the initial scan to better understand the connection between anxiety and brain structure.

“We’re now interested in looking at changes over time to see if anxiety has an effect one way or the other on how fast the brain damage progresses,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We will also take a closer look at gender differences in the association between anxiety and cognitive decline.”

# Coronavirus UK: Sussex and Herefordshire cases soar as Tiers decided

Advertisement

An interactive module has today revealed how quickly coronavirus outbreaks are growing in every local authority in England as millions wait for Boris Johnson to declare which areas will be subject to Tier Three restrictions when the second national lockdown ends next week.

As Britain approached Autumn only five of around 200 local authorities had a weekly Covid-19 infection rate above 100 cases per 100,000 people. Only 24 areas still have an infection rate that is in the double figures.

East Sussex, Herefordshire and Milton Keynes were the local authorities in England that suffered the biggest spikes in coronavirus cases during the most recent week, making them among the most likely to enter Tier Three rules that force restaurants to move to takeaway only.

Public Health England statistics show infection rates — the number of new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people — shot up by at least 50 per cent in all three areas in the seven-day spell ending November 15. Kent, parts of Essex and London also saw large rises, according to the data MailOnline has used to make an interactive tool.

Meanwhile, the areas that saw the greatest falls in cases were almost all in Tier Three in the North West, adding further evidence that the local lockdown system appears to work. Warrington, Oldham, Wigan and Blackburn, all of which suffered huge numbers of infections during England's second wave, saw declines of 30 per cent or more.

Boris Johnson last night confirmed the country's second draconian lockdown will end on December 2, with No10 opting to return to a revamped three-tier system that could have to remain in place until at least March 31 — more than a year after the first lockdown began.

Ministers are waiting for the most up-to-date data to decide what brackets individual authorities will be placed in, with the breakdown set to be published on Thursday. Policymakers will analyse rates of infections, test positivity and speed of outbreak growth to decide on the measures.

The worst-hit areas including Hull and the North West are expected to be placed under the toughest Tier Three, which forces restaurants and pubs to shut — unless they offer takeaways.

Debate rages on over which bracket London should be in, with the capital's mayor Sadiq Khan predicting the city will face Tier Two — which bans mixing indoors with other households. But senior Tories including Sir Iain Duncan Smith last night demanded the city, the beating heart of the UK's economy, is put under Tier One.

Northern mayors have voiced opposition to plans to put them into higher tiers, with Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham saying they could trigger 'widespread business failure' in the region. MPs have warned T2 and T3 will be 'catastrophic' for businesses and spark a damaging new mutiny.

Whitehall sources told the Daily Mail last night that very few areas would be afforded Tier One restrictions, with only the rural regions — such as Cornwall and South Oxfordshire — likely to see the lightest rules applied.

Britain today recorded 11,299 Covid-19 cases in the lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks, but deaths rose again to 608 which is the highest toll since May.

‹ Slide me › Above are infections before winter in September (right) and those on November 18 (left) after the second lockdown

Covid-19 cases have fallen across most of the North of England since lockdown was imposed, but they are rising in a corner of the South East. The percentage change is based on comparing data from the week ending November 15 to the week ending November 8. It comes as the Government prepares to unveil its tier system

The onerous tiered system will be in place across England from December 3 until the end of March, the Prime Minister said

COVID RESTRICTIONS WILL BE EASED OVER CHRISTMAS FOR FIVE DAYS, OFFICIALS CONFIRM Coronavirus restrictions will be eased across the UK for five days at Christmas to allow up to three households to meet indoors after the four home nations agreed a joint plan to loosen draconian curbs over the festive period. A four-nation meeting of the Cobra emergency committee agreed the proposals this afternoon. The relaxed measures will be in place from Wednesday December 23 to Sunday December 27, paving the way for families in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to meet up. It came after Nicola Sturgeon had earlier suggested the Christmas respite from coronavirus lockdown would not be entirely the same in Scotland. The First Minister said she hoped there would be an agreement on a 'common framework' for the festive season. But she hinted at splits between the nations saying the 'precise definition of household' is likely to vary. Scotland currently has different rules on gatherings compared to England, including not including under-12s in limits on numbers. Meanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has admitted that loosening the restrictions over Christmas will inevitably lead to more cases of the deadly disease. Frantic efforts have been going on for days to find a joint position for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to allow some kind of family Christmas. Advertisement

Matt Hancock claims Tier Three restrictions before lockdown weren't enough to stop the virus;

He also told a Parliamentary committee that after the pandemic Britons should stop 'soldiering on' and going to the office with a cold or runny nose;

Sir Jeremy Farrar, from the Wellcome Trust and a member of SAGE, said there was enough data for Britain to lockdown in January;

Today 11,299 Covid-19 cases were recorded in the lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks, but deaths rose to 608 in highest toll since May.

The Prime Minister warned last night: 'We expect more regions to fall, at least temporally, into higher levels than before but by using these tougher tiers and by using rapid turnaround tests on an ever greater scale to drive R below one.'

But he added the toughened tiers should make it possible for local authorities 'to move down the tier-ing scale to lower levels of restrictions' as cases start to plummet.

The previous system was heavily criticised for putting areas into Tier Three and then seemingly giving them no clear-cut way out of the curbs.

Toughest restrictions are likely to be applied to areas with the highest infection rates as well as those that have been growing the fastest in recent weeks.

Public Health England data shows a North-South divide that is seeing positive rates increasing faster in parts of the South of the country and in London, while rates are highest – but falling fastest – in the North.

This is likely a legacy of the original three-tier system which saw much of Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire thrust into the toughest local rules before the national lockdown while much of the South didn't have any at all.

North Lincolnshire was the only part of the country further north than the Midlands that featured in the top 20 places with the fastest rate of increase in the week up to November 15. The data counts positive test results that came through the Department of Health's official testing programme.

Ten of the top 20 were boroughs of London – Greenwich, Enfield, Merton, Croydon, Havering, Camden, Hammersmith & Fulham, Bromley, Kingston upon Thames and Hackney & the City of London.

Other areas that saw their positive case counts increase by 25 per cent or more in a week were East Sussex, Herefordshire, Milton Keynes, Kent, Medway, Southend-on-Sea, Slough, North Lincolnshire, Bedford and Cornwall.

Meanwhile, 17 out of the 20 areas that saw the biggest falls in their infection rates during the same week were all ones that were in Tier Three, with the exception only of Torbay in Devon, North East Lincolnshire and Derby.

Local authorities which had been in the toughest local rules before England's national lockdown on November 5 but then saw infections drop by 18 per cent or more in the second week of November were: St Helens, Wirral, Knowsley and Warrington in Merseyside; Manchester, Bury, Tameside, Rochdale, Trafford, Salford, Wigan and Oldham in Greater Manchester; and Doncaster, Sheffield, Nottingham and Blackburn with Darwen.

WHAT ARE THE NEW TIER RULES? Tier One will be the default and measures will not be allowed to get more relaxed in any part of England: Rule of six and social distancing apply to gatherings indoors and outdoors;

Pubs and restaurants are allowed to open with table service only and an 11pm closing time. Tier Two: People from separate households cannot meet indoors and the rule of six applies outside;

Pubs must close unless operating as restaurants, with alcoholic drinks served alongside meals; Tier Three will be the toughest level of restrictions and rules have been tightened up to make them stricter than before. All of the Tier Two rules apply as well as the following: Indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, theatres and bowling alleys must close;

Pubs, restaurants and cafes must close except for takeaway;

Shops and hairdressers and salons will be allowed to remain open;

Groups of six will be allowed to meet outdoors only;

Crowds at live events will be banned;

People should avoid travelling out of, or into, Tier Three areas unless it is unavoidable. Advertisement

Politicians and local leaders are today gathering to mount substantial challenges to the restrictions.

In the capital, Tory heavyweight Sir Iain has told the Telegraph that it 'must' be placed in Tier One to revive the country.

'London is dominant in the economy and we need it to get back to work immediately,' he said.

Another London MP told the Guardian they were 'fiercely lobbying' for pubs, bars and restaurants to be re-opened in the capital.

Sadiq Khan told LBC yesterday: 'It's a bit early to say yet, but based on the numbers that I've seen, which is a slowdown in the virus spreading, it's coming down in parts of London in a couple of boroughs.'

'What I hope would happen is... London would probably be in what is called Tier Two.'

None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures from the seven-day spell ending November 15, the latest date for which data is available.

But in 20 of the 32 boroughs the infection rate rose last week, with the biggest jumps in Havering, Enfield and Redbridge.

The highest infection rate is in Havering, in the north-east of the city, the only borough where they surged above 300 per 100,000.

The number of patients being rushed to hospital in the capital suffering from Covid-19 remains low, according to the Department of Health, at a seven-day average of 154.7 admissions on November 17. But this is far below the peak of the first wave, when on average 748 patients were being taken to hospital with Covid-19 every day.

These levels are also among the lowest in the country, which ministers are expected to argue mean that London can be spared the sharpest curbs on public freedoms.

Mayors in the North of England are also mounting opposition to yet again being placed under higher tiers, with Sheffield city leader Dan Jarvis warning: 'We're willing to do our bit, but we must not be taken for granted.'

Daily hospitalisation rates with Covid-19 across England Region North East&Yorks Midland North West London South East South West East of England Daily admissions 360.7 354.7 239.4 154.7 150.3 110.4 97.9 % change -8.2% -5.5% -14.8% +12.3% +9.5% -8.3% +6.1% This data is based on the latest figures from the Department of Health. Daily admissions is the seven-day average of admissions to November 17. And % change is based on the difference between the average on November 17 and November 10. Advertisement

He added: 'Tougher restrictions have had a massive impact on South Yorkshire's economy.

'The Government said it will return to its levelling up agenda after the pandemic, but the brutal reality is we cannot wait that long.

'At Wednesday's Spending Review, the Government has a golden opportunity to deliver on its promises.

'I've pressed Ministers to bring forward major investment, to give the North the best chance of weathering the storm, ensure businesses survive a tough winter and allow us to kick start the job of economic recovery and renewal.'

Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham has come out hard against being plunged into the toughest measures.

Mr Burnham said a toughened Tier Three 'could be devastating for the hospitality industry and will hit cities and the city economy very, very hard indeed'.

Across England Swale, in Kent, has the worst infection rate in the country at 631.7 per 100,000.

Local leaders there have spoken of their 'frustration' that residents appear not to be following restrictions, and taking simple precautions such as wearing a face mask.

Swale's council leader, Roger Truelove, said lockdown rules in the borough were being 'willfully disregarded', with residents regularly not wearing face coverings and ignoring social distancing.

An emergency council meeting was held yesterday to discuss why the district - which is home to about 150,000 and includes the Isle of Sheppey - has seen such rapid growth of the virus.

THERE WAS ENOUGH INFORMATION ON COVID-19 TO ACT IN JANUARY, SAYS SCIENTIST Enough was known about coronavirus in January to act straight away, but the response was delayed, a leading scientist has said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said that while information about the virus was 'uncertain', action could have been taken. At the start of January the World Health Organisation was aware of a cluster of pneumonia cases - with no deaths - in Wuhan, China, and shared detailed information with member states. Speaking at the Imperial College London's Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics's (J-IDEA) symposium on a post-Covid world, Sir Jeremy said the response to the information was delayed. He said: 'The information you have early may be uncertain, but it's enough to act on. 'I would say that at the end of January we knew enough to have acted. And we waited. 'We waited out of uncertainty, we wanted to be more certain than we needed to be. 'But by the end of January, we knew that this was able to transmit asymptomatically, that it caused a nasty clinical syndrome and a significant number of people were dying, that healthcare workers were getting sick and distant family members were getting sick when people moved from Wuhan to Sichuan, that this was going out of China into other parts of south-east Asia, that we had no diagnostics, no treatment and no vaccines. 'To me, at the time - and this is not in retrospect - I think that was enough to have acted then in ways that we delayed.' Advertisement

The latest analysis of PHE figures, by the Press Association news agency, found Covid-19 case rates started to fall in most local areas across England in the most recent week, up to November 15.

Only two of nine regions - London and the South East - are still recording week-on-week rises in cases. The full impact of England's second national lockdown, however, is yet to become apparent in the data.

It takes up to two weeks for someone who has caught the virus to show symptoms, get tested, and receive a positive result. This means that many infections currently being reported may have occurred before the emergency measures were brought in.

But the latest figures suggest the numbers are heading in the right direction, though not in all parts of England.

The nationwide restrictions began on November 5, and the most recent figures are for the week ending November 15 – just 14 days into the lockdown.

Infection surges were recorded in 34 out of 67 local authorities in the South East, with Medway seeing the biggest jump.

Medway, in Kent, had the sixth biggest surge in infections in the country when they rose by 39.3 per cent to 299 per 100,000.

But the biggest week-on-week falls were recorded in the North West - signalling that earlier measures were helping to drive down cases alongside the lockdown.

Warrington saw the biggest fall in England, where infections dropped by 32.5 per cent to 259.6 per 100,000.

It was followed by Oldham, in Greater Manchester, where infections fell by 30.7 per cent to 519.2 per 100,000.

And Wigan saw the third biggest fall with a 30.3 per cent drop to 403.2 per 100,000.

When the tiered system returns on December 3, they will be reviewed every two weeks to establish whether local authorities need to have stricter curbs imposed or can be dropped to lower restrictions.

It is set to be in place until March 31, at which point the tiered system will come to an end.

Boris Johnson said last night that he hoped the country would be able to get back to normal 'by Easter', predicting this could be when the elderly and most vulnerable members of the population will have received a Covid-19 vaccine.

Three vaccines - including Oxford's jab - have said they are at least 70 per cent effective at triggering an immune response, prompting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to say 'the end of the tunnel' of the pandemic is in sight.

GRANT SHAPPS URGES BRITONS NOT TO USE TRAINS AT CHRISTMAS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE TOO BUSY Grant Shapps today urged Britons not to use trains at Christmas because they will be 'too busy' - as UK ministers meet to thrash out a plan to ease coronavirus rules so family reunions can happen. An announcement is imminent on proposals for a loosening over the festive season, with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove due to chair a Cobra meeting with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But the Transport Secretary has warned that the rail network's 'limitations', with major engineering work and capacity constraints, mean people should avoid using it where possible. In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Shapps said: 'We are going to be appealing to people to look very carefully at the transport route they take and of course even making a choice about whether they travel at all.' News on how restrictions on socialising will be relaxed for a few days - probably from December 23-27 - had been expected today, but might now come later in the week, as sources say 'details need ironing out'. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there could be a 'slight and careful' easing of the rules for a few days while Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething has suggested tough measures to control the virus before Christmas could allow 'more headroom for the festive season'. Mr Gove is set to chair a meeting with the devolved administrations later, in a bid to get the package over the line. Advertisement

The UK has ordered 100million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, with up to four million set to arrive this year. It is also expecting the first part of a delivery of 40million doses from Pfizer and BioNtech - who say their vaccine is 90 per cent effective - by the end of the year, and five million doses from Moderna - with a 94.5 per cent effective shot - in the spring next year.

Leaked NHS plans reveal they could start vaccinating the elderly and most vulnerable against the virus in early December, with vaccines being rolled out to the rest of the population in the new year.

But scientists have urged caution, warning none of the jabs have yet been approved for use by the UK's regulator the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The regulator reviews data on vaccine effectiveness and how safe it is before deciding whether or not to allow it to be administered across the country. It is a process that usually takes two years but, amid pressure to get life back to normal, the regulator has said it is working hard to make a decision quickly.

The Prime Minister detailed his winter strategy yesterday, with a plan to deploy a major testing scheme in an attempt to win over rebels on the Conservative backbenches.

He told tell MPs that non-essential shops can open in all three tiers after the current restrictions expire on December 2, in a boost for retailers.

Mr Johnson also set out the basis of plans to allow a small number of households across the UK to mix over a limited number of days around Christmas.

Vaccines and tiers – all your questions answered

When are we coming out of national lockdown?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the national lockdown imposed on November 5 will come to an end on December 2.

However, England will then move back into a regional tiered system of restrictions – similar to those introduced earlier this year.

What is the tier system?

There are three different tiers of restrictions, which will be imposed at a regional level depending on the number of coronavirus cases in that area.

Those living under Tier 1 restrictions will have the greatest freedoms, while people in Tiers 2 and 3 will face stricter measures.

Official testing data shows that coronavirus infection rates are falling across the North of England, where they were highest during the peak of the second wave, but they remain high in some areas of the West Midlands, Kent, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire (Darker colours indicate higher rates of positive tests per 100,000 people)

LONDON LOCKDOWN REVOLT: MPS WARN PUTTING CAPITAL IN T3 WOULD BE A 'DISASTER' In 20 of London's 32 regions last week there were increases in infection rates. The biggest jumps being Havering (up from 309.4 to 386.0), Enfield (up from 175.6 to 230.4) and Redbridge (up from 249.0 to 300.4) Boris Johnson has been warned by furious London Tories that it would be an economic 'disaster' if the capital was hit with the toughest possible coronavirus restrictions after lockdown ends. City MPs and the Conservative candidate for mayor, Shaun Bailey, sent the Prime Minister a clear warning after it emerged officials could place the metropolis into the top Tier 3 after December 2. They warned such a move could cripple London's entertainment and hospitality industries, with pubs and restaurants open for takeaway and delivery sales only and theatres and other venues remaining closed. None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures. But speaking to business leaders via Zoom last night, Mr Bailey said: 'I absolutely agree it would be a disaster for London if we were in Tier 3. Advertisement

How will they decide on what tier to introduce?

Regions with high numbers of cases will face tighter measures, while those with fewer cases will have their restrictions relaxed.

To decide which tier to apply to a specific area, officials will look at coronavirus cases across all age groups, and specifically among the over-60s who are considered most at risk.

They will also consider whether infection rates are rising or falling and the prevalence of the disease per 100,000 of the population.

When will I find out what tier I'm in?

An announcement will be made on Thursday.

What is allowed under each tier?

Under Tier 1, people can meet a maximum of six friends or family outdoors or indoors.

Pubs and restaurants can reopen, but with table service only and an 11pm closing time.

In Tier 2, people from two different households cannot mix indoors, and outdoor gatherings will be limited to six.

Pubs will remain closed unless operating as restaurants, with alcohol only served as part of a 'substantial meal'.

Retail and personal care – such as hairdressers and beauty salons – can reopen in all tiers, and indoor entertainment venues – such as cinemas, theatres, bowling alleys and casinos – will be allowed to stay open in Tiers 1 and 2, but not Tier 3.

Tier 3 areas will see the hospitality sector remain closed except for takeaways, and groups of six will only be able to meet in outdoor public spaces.

Can I travel between tiers?

People in Tier 3 areas should avoid travelling to other parts of the UK, including for overnight stays unless it is for work, education, health or care requirements.

Likewise, those in Tier 1 and 2 areas should not travel to Tier 3 zones, but can pass through them as part of a longer journey.

Should I start making plans for Christmas?

Not just yet. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was unable to confirm on Monday any details as to how people would be able to spend the festive period.

However, a plan to allow families to be reunited for Christmas is being developed with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

HANCOCK CLAIMS T3 WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH BEFORE LOCKDOWN Matt Hancock has claimed Tier Three restrictions imposed before lockdown were not tough enough to halt the spread of Covid-19, and revealed he hopes damaging restrictions on Britons lives will be lifted after Easter. Speaking to Parliament's Health and Social Care Committee, the 'architect' of the tiered system said he was convinced a second lockdown was needed when cases suddenly surged in all areas of England. The then-spiralling numbers, he said, meant that 'even in the lower prevalence areas you could see they were going to get to high prevalence if we didn't act'. Public Health England data reveals the sharpest spike in infections across England was in the week ending October 4, when almost every local authority saw Covid-19 infections surge by more than 50 per cent. Ministers then rushed out the tiered system - which came into force on October 14 - in an attempt to suppress escalating cases. But just 23 days later - and amid growing evidence that Tier Three was driving down infections - they hit the nuclear button and imposed a second nationwide lockdown. The Health Secretary and Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove are thought to have been the main supporters of the stringent measures in the cabinet. Mr Hancock appeared today in front of the committee to answer questions on the Government's handling of the pandemic, including whether Test and Trace is working, whether the first lockdown was imposed early enough and why a circuit breaker was avoided. Boris Johnson yesterday unveiled his beefed-up tier system, with Tier Three now forcing all restaurants and bars to shift to take-away only. Advertisement

Is there a vaccine yet?

Not quite. Although vaccine developers have started to publish the interim results from their trials, which have so far been positive.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca team announced its vaccine had proved up to 90% effective.

When will it be ready?

No one can be certain at this stage as no vaccine has been approved for use yet.

But the jab is likely to be rolled out in the UK from December, with the bulk of vaccination in the new year.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, if all goes well in the next couple of weeks, the vaccination programme could potentially be rolled out from next month for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.

Will I have to pay for a jab?

No, the vaccine will be free on the NHS.

Will there be enough for everyone?

The Government said it has secured access to more than 350 million doses of vaccine from seven developers between now and the end of 2021, which is enough to potentially vaccinate the whole population.

Do I have to get a vaccine?

There are no plans to make vaccination compulsory, Downing Street said earlier in November.

However, Mr Hancock has also refused to rule out making it mandatory.

How long will immunity last?

The Government said in its Covid Winter Plan that the exact strength and duration of immunity provided through vaccination is not yet known.

Protection through vaccination takes time to build and requires a full course, but it is still unknown how well the first vaccines will stop the virus from passing between people.

Can I choose what vaccine I get?

As things stand, the vaccines will be rolled out as and when they become available, depending on which are approved first and how quickly companies can make them.

No announcement has been made on whether one might be given priority over another as they become ready on a mass scale.

People are not expected to be able to choose which jab they want to receive.

When will life return to normal?

While it is not known exactly how long it might take for the population to be vaccinated, Mr Hancock has said it is looking as though things may start returning to normal after Easter.

But until then, and until there is some kind of herd immunity in the population, achieved through vaccination, people will need to continue to wear face masks, socially distance and wash their hands.";"(2019-12-13)

# Coronavirus England: Deaths rise 28% in one week to 2,466

Advertisement

Covid deaths in England continued to rise in mid-November to 2,274 in the second week of the month, meaning deaths from all causes were 19 per cent higher than usual for the time of year.

Office for National Statistics data published today shows there were 1,833 excess deaths in the week that ended November 13, with a total of 11,495 people dying.

Although higher than average, the figure is only just over half the 21,157 deaths from all causes in England's worst week in April during the peak of the first wave — when Covid claimed around 8,000 lives.

The number of people dying with the viral infection is now on par with those succumbing to flu or pneumonia for the first time since June.

The coronavirus deaths recorded in the week that ended November 13 were a rise of 503 on the 1,771 recorded in the first week of the month. The data won't take into account any effects of lockdown because it can take infected patients several weeks to fall severely ill.

Figures show that numbers of people dying of any cause is higher than average in all regions, with the northern parts of England still worst hit by Covid. In the North West, deaths are 38 per cent higher than usual, while in the South East they are only marginally higher at two per cent.

Hospitals, care homes and private homes are all seeing more fatalities than they would expect to at this time of year, and one in five deaths are now linked to Covid-19, compared to one in six a week earlier. But the ONS data is backdated and known to be too old to reflect the current situation in the country.

Department of Health death counts, which take in daily totals from hospitals and care homes for the whole UK, suggest that the number of people being killed by Covid-19 has started to level off after a surge in October.

In the last three weeks of October, from the 10th to the 31st, the average number of people dying with coronavirus each day soared four-fold from 63 to 259, while in the first three weeks of November it rose far more slowly – by 57 per cent from 260 to 409.

There are signs of a flattening in the trend, although experts have warned deaths will likely stay in the hundreds per day for weeks to come as the effects of huge numbers of infections in October and early November continue to trickle through.

The deaths recorded in this week's ONS release all happened between November 7 and November 13.

Because it generally takes between two and three weeks for Covid victims to die after they have caught the virus, this means that most of the coronavirus deaths in the updated numbers were people who got infected in the last week of October.

This means the number of people dying was still increasing in this week as a result of the fast-growing numbers of infections the country saw as the second wave spiralled out of control.

The ONS itself estimated that more than 50,000 people were catching the virus every day by the end of last month, with a Government-funded study suggesting the figure could have been as high as 100,000 a day.

Although lockdown appears to have brought this under control – estimates suggest the R rate has fallen noticeably and that daily infections were down to around 39,000 after the first week of lockdown – it will take weeks for this to filter through into the death counts.

Daily case counts were first to fall when the effects of lockdown started to sink in – the average number of new positive tests has fallen from a peak of 25,000 a day nine days ago to 19,500 now.

Hospitalisations will follow suit as fewer infections leads to fewer severe cases, and then deaths will drop as the total numbers of people in hospitals falls.

Although the number of people dying is not surging as fast as it did during the UK's first wave of Covid-19, it still marks the deaths of hundreds of people every day.

Dr Sarah Scobie, research director at the Nuffield Trust health think-tank, said today: 'Despite the end of the second national lockdown in England coming into focus, today’s figures are a sobering reminder of the dreadful impact of this virus.

'For the first time since the end of the first wave, over 2,000 Covid deaths have been registered in a single week.

'We've seen a sharp jump in the number of deaths in hospital in the week ending November 13, with Covid now accounting for a third of patients dying in hospital. Deaths in care homes and private homes are also higher than we'd expect at this time of year.'

Today's ONS update showed that all English regions, and Wales, saw a higher number of registered deaths than the five-year average.

North West England had 615 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in the week ending November 13 – the highest number for the region since the week ending May 15.

LOSS OF TASTE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IN SECOND WAVE A lost sense of taste was the most common symptom among people with coronavirus in England's second wave, Office for National Statistics data suggests. The ONS analysed reports of symptoms among people getting swabbed in its mass testing programme between August and October. Symptoms around the time of the test were considered. It compared how often people with a certain symptom tested positive, and how often people with certain symptoms tested positive for the virus. It found that loss of taste was far more common among positive cases than coughs or fevers, which are seen as the more typical and obvious signs of Covid-19. Between 35 and 45 per cent of people testing positive for coronavirus lost their sense of taste, the ONS found. Its graphs suggested that as many as 45 per cent of people between the ages of 18 and 35 experienced the effect, compared to 30 per cent of older or younger age groups. By comparison, fever was found in around 10-20 per cent of people, and coughing in 10 per cent or fewer. The report said people with symptoms tested positive more often than those without: 'The positivity rates in those with specific symptoms or other evidence of symptoms are higher than those not reporting any evidence of symptoms.' It added in a series of caveats that the symptoms were self-reported and not diagnosed by a doctor, and that they did not include those among people who were in hospitals or care homes.

In Yorkshire and the Humber, 450 Covid-19 deaths were registered in that week, while there were 284 in the West Midlands and 245 in the East Midlands.

Weekly registered deaths not involving Covid-19 were below the five-year average for the third consecutive week, the ONS said.

A total of 68,524 deaths have so far been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, according to the latest reports from the UK’s statistics agencies.

This includes 62,162 deaths in England and Wales up to November 13 which were confirmed by the ONS on Tuesday.

Since these statistics were compiled, a further 2,432 deaths are known to have occurred in England, plus 80 in Scotland, 128 in Wales and 91 in Northern Ireland, according to additional data published on the Government’s coronavirus dashboard.

Together, these totals mean that so far 71,255 deaths involving Covid-19 have taken place in the UK, when figures from the statistical bodies of Scotland and Northern Ireland are also included.

These are deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.

Of all deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales, around two thirds occurred in hospital, (40,062 deaths), the figures show.

The remainder occurred in care homes (16,849 deaths), private homes (2,927 deaths), hospices (833 deaths), other communal establishments (242 deaths) and elsewhere (223 deaths).

More than 30,000 excess deaths not linked to Covid-19 have occurred in private homes since the start of the pandemic.

There were 30,785 non-Covid excess deaths in homes in England and Wales registered between March 7 and November 13, the ONS said.

In a separate report published this morning the ONS revealed that a lost sense of taste was the most common symptom among people with coronavirus in England's second wave.

The ONS analysed reports of symptoms among people getting swabbed in its mass testing programme between August and October.

It compared how often people with a certain symptom tested positive, and how often people with certain symptoms tested positive for the virus.

It found that loss of taste was far more common among positive cases than coughs or fevers, which are seen as the more typical and obvious signs of Covid-19.

# Anxiety Associated With Faster Alzheimer’s Disease Onset

Summary: Anxiety may accelerate the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. Brain scans revealed patients who progressed from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease had decreased volume in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

Source: RSNA

Anxiety is associated with an increased rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study being presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Alzheimer’s disease represents a major public health crisis worldwide. The number of deaths from the disease has more than doubled since 2000, and it is currently the fifth-leading cause of death among individuals over 65 in the U.S.

Many people with Alzheimer’s disease first suffer from mild cognitive impairment, a decline in cognitive abilities like memory and thinking skills that is more rapid than normally associated with aging. Anxiety has been frequently observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment, although its role in disease progression is not well understood.

“We know that volume loss in certain areas of the brain is a factor that predicts progression to Alzheimer’s disease,” said study senior author Maria Vittoria Spampinato, M.D., professor of radiology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston. “In this study, we wanted to see if anxiety had an effect on brain structure, or if the effect of anxiety was independent from brain structure in favoring the progression of disease.”

The study group included 339 patients, average age of 72 years, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 cohort. Each person had a baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment; 72 progressed to Alzheimer’s disease while 267 remained stable.

The researchers obtained brain MRIs to determine the baseline volumes of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, two areas important to forming memories. They also tested for the presence of the ApoE4 allele, the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Anxiety was measured with established clinical surveys.

As expected, patients who progressed to Alzheimer’s disease had significantly lower volumes in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex and greater frequency of the ApoE4 allele. Most notably though, the researchers found that anxiety was independently associated with cognitive decline.

“Mild cognitive impairment patients with anxiety symptoms developed Alzheimer’s disease faster than individuals without anxiety, independently of whether they had a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease or brain volume loss,” said study first author Jenny L. Ulber, a medical student at MUSC.

The link between anxiety symptoms and a faster progression to Alzheimer’s disease presents an opportunity for improving the screening and management of patients with early mild cognitive impairment, the researchers said.

“We need to better understand the association between anxiety disorders and cognitive decline,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We don’t know yet if the anxiety is a symptom–in other words, their memory is getting worse and they become anxious–or if anxiety contributes to cognitive decline. If we were able in the future to find that anxiety is actually causing progression, then we should more aggressively screen for anxiety disorders in the elderly.”

“The geriatric population is routinely screened for depression in many hospitals, but perhaps this vulnerable population should also be assessed for anxiety disorders,” Ulber added. “Middle-aged and elderly individuals with high level of anxiety may benefit from intervention, whether it be pharmacological or cognitive behavioral therapy, with the goal of slowing cognitive decline.”

The study was based on MRI scans done at one point in time. For future research, the team would like to study MRIs obtained after the initial scan to better understand the connection between anxiety and brain structure.

“We’re now interested in looking at changes over time to see if anxiety has an effect one way or the other on how fast the brain damage progresses,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We will also take a closer look at gender differences in the association between anxiety and cognitive decline.”

# Unexpectedly cooking Thanksgiving this year? Tips on how to stay safe

Plenty of first-time chefs will enter the kitchen on Thursday as coronavirus shifts around typical Thanksgiving traditions and celebrations, but that doesn’t mean it has to end in an injury-riddled disaster. Even if you consider yourself an expert chef, there are precautions you can consider to help keep you, and your loved ones, safe in the kitchen this holiday season.

Start out by familiarizing yourself with general safety guidelines regarding hot liquids, pots and pans. For instance, don’t place pots of hot food or liquid on the floor, especially if there are kids in the house, Dr. Nicole Bernal, medical director of burn services at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.

She also advised against putting hot liquids near the edge of the table, or within reaching distance of toddlers and babies, as it can cause burns or serious injury.

GATHERING FOR THANKSGIVING AMID CORONAVIRUS WORTH THE RISK, 1 IN 3 PARENTS SAY

“Water heated in a microwave can cause a third-degree burn after five seconds of exposure,” Bernal told Fox News. “Soups and gravy can cause a more severe burn when spilled because the food components hold in the heat and sit on the skin surface causing a deeper burn.”

To that end, pot and pan placement while cooking can also play a role in maintaining safety while in the kitchen.

“It’s important to remember to turn the long handles of pots and pans inward,” Bernal said. “When they hang off the edge, they can easily get hit or caught on clothing causing hot food to spill. Keep a large lid near the stove if cooking with oil. If there is a fire, put the lid on the pan to put out [the] fire quickly. Do not try to lift or move a pan of burning oil.”

And for those choosing to deep fry their turkey this year, remember to put the fryer outside, and not in the garage or inside another part of the house, “and never ever put a frozen turkey in a deep fryer,” she said.

Handling hot items like pans or baking dishes should always be done while wearing protective gloves or mitts instead of a kitchen towel.

“Heat transfers through a towel easily and a loose towel can catch fire if it gets near a gas burner or oven coil,” Bernal said.

Opening an oven, too, should be done cautiously. It is important to make sure the area is clear of children, pets, or any other unsuspecting guests who may be injured while the oven door is open and unattended, she said.

CDC UPDATES CORONAVIRUS THANKSGIVING GUIDANCE, URGES AGAINST TRAVEL

And even with added measures, mistakes and accidents will happen in kitchens across the nation, but there are steps you can take to help mitigate the damage. It’s also important to know what signs to look for should the burn need medical attention.

“If you get a burn, remove clothing and jewelry from the area and run under cool tap water for 5-10 minutes,” Bernal said. “Do not place in ice water or apply ice, this will decrease blood flow to the injured areas and can cause the burn to become third degree, which is the deepest type of burn. It also makes the burn more painful when the area is removed from the ice water and blood flow returns to the area.”

If the skin is simply red and painful without blisters, it is likely a first-degree burn and can be cared for with gauze and ibuprofen to reduce inflammation.

However, if the affected skin starts to peel or blister, the injury is either a second or third-degree burn and needs to be looked at by a physician, Bernal said. It is important to remove clothing and jewelry and run the area under cool water, but do not pop or remove the blister without first speaking to a physician, she said. At that point, a physician can instruct you on daily wound care to prevent infection.

“If areas of burned skin are blistering or peeling and [are] larger than the palm of your hand, call your physician to be evaluated,” she said. “If the burned area that is blistering or peeling is greater than four of your hands, then go to the emergency department. Cover the wound with a clean dressing and antibiotic ointment if you have [one] available. Do not put household items on the burns like mustard, egg white, toothpaste, or honey. This can make it difficult to examine the burn and can be very painful to wash off.”";"(2019-12-13)
# Treat burns with egg whites.

Egg Whites Prevent Burns?
The application of egg whites will prevent burns?
Example:   [Collected via e-mail, July 2011]

A young man sprinkling his lawn and bushes with pesticides wanted to check the contents of the barrel to see how much pesticide remained in it. He raised the cover and lit his lighter; the vapors inflamed and engulfed him.  He jumped from his truck, screaming.  His neighbor came out of her house with a dozen eggs, yelling: “bring me some eggs!”  She broke them, separating the whites from the yolks.  The neighbor woman helped her to apply the whites on the young man’s face. When the ambulance arrived and when the EMTs saw the young man, they asked who had done this.  Everyone pointed to the lady in charge.  They congratulated her and said: “You have saved his face.”  By the end of the summer, the young man brought the lady a bouquet of roses to thank her.  His face was like a baby’s skin.
Healing Miracle for burns:
Keep in mind this treatment of burns which is included in teaching beginner fireman this method. First aid consists to spraying cold water on the affected area until the heat is reduced and stops burning the layers of skin. Then, spread egg whites on the affected area.

   
[Collected via e-mail, April 2011]

Treating burns.
Egg white
One hopes never to be needing it, but just in case:…
A simple but effective way to treat burns with the help of egg white.
This method is used in the training of firemen.
When sustaining a burn, regardless the degree, the first aid is always placing the injured part under running cold water till the heat subsides.
And next spread the egg white over the injury.
Someone burned a large part of her hand with boiling water. Despite the pain she held her hand under running water, then took two eggs, parted the yolk from the egg white and slightly beat the egg white and put her hand in it. Her hand was so badly burned that the egg white dried and formed a white film. Later she heard that the egg is a natural collagen.
And during the next hour layer upon layer, she administered a white layer on her hand. That afternoon she didn’t feel any more pain and the next day there hardly was a red mark to see. She thought she would have an awful scar but to her astonishment after ten days there was no sign of the burn, the skin had it’s normal color again!
The burned area had been totally regenerated thanks to the collagen, in reality a placenta full of vitamins.
This advice can be useful for everyone.

   
Origins:   Akin to another Internet-spread rumor regarding the treatment of burns (which involved placing the injured extremity into a bag of flour), this seemingly helpful heads up also began making the online rounds in March 2011. In a nutshell, don’t do it, because the danger of introducing salmonella into an open wound should not be toyed with.
The Internet-spread egg white remedy is somewhat more reliable in its approach to treating minor burns at home in that it outright states one should first cool the injured area completely with cold water before applying anything to the wound, yet even in regard to that exhortation, it’s a bit off the mark:


When sustaining a burn, regardless the degree, [emphasis ours] the first aid is always placing the injured part under running cold water till the heat subsides.


In the case of very severe burns, do not run cold water over the wound. Says the Mayo Clinic of the treatment of third degree burns: “Don’t immerse large severe burns in cold water. Doing so could cause a drop in body temperature (hypothermia) and deterioration of blood pressure and circulation (shock).”
First degree burns (which are the least severe of the three classes of this type of injury) are the only sort one should be trying to treat at home without summoning additional medical assistance. Effective first aid begins with stopping the burning process; otherwise, the affected flesh continues to cook, further damaging the injured area. For this reason, the recommended action is to immediately immerse the burned area in cool water or under gently running cool water for a minimum of five minutes. Doing so halts the burning process, numbs the pain, and prevents or reduces swelling. If the injury cannot be immersed or positioned under a faucet, cool water is to be poured over it for the same amount of time. Never use ice on burns.
Only after the wound has been effectively cooled should the injured area be dried off, then dressed with a clean bandage. (Bandaging can be omitted when the injury is small and there is no break in the skin.) Neither butter nor oil 
should ever be applied to any burn, although once the wound has been properly cooled and dried, antibiotic ointments or aloe vera gel could be applied before dressing the area.
While the treatment of second degree burns also begins with cooling injured areas with cold water until wound temperature has been brought down, its second step is hand-off to a medical professional. For anything more than a minor burn, get the injured person swiftly to a doctor as opposed to attempt to continue treatment on one’s own. As for third degree burns, keep the victim breathing and summon medical help. In the interim before help’s arrival, drape damp cloths over the wounded areas, but do not immerse any of the victim’s body parts in cold water, and do not attempt to cut clothing from the victim.
Regarding the rest of the e-mail, fire fighters are not instructed as part of their training to treat burns with egg white. Instead, they learn at-the-scene first aid procedures, which mostly amount to keeping airways open, reducing the temperature of burned areas, then handing off burn victims to medical professionals. 
However, that firefighters aren’t being taught to slather burn victims with albumen doesn’t mean that at one time providing exactly that treatment wasn’t a somewhat recommended practice, as we’ve found turn-of-the-century medical journals that advocated the use of egg white on minor burns. Now, granted, most of those references promoted such use as a way of shielding injured areas from contamination (that is, using egg white to create a protective barrier between wound and air), but there was also suggestion that the application of this substance would take the pain out of the injury. (Mind you, those selfsame journals also offered up the information that a number of other wet, dense dressings, such as olive oil or a mixture of baking soda and water, would act just as effectively as a wound protectant and calmative for minor burns.)
This doctor, however, in an 1899 article presented the use of egg whites on burns, not as a protective dressing, but as a remedy for that particular sort of injury. (This is the only reference of its kind that we’ve so far happened upon; all others made no claim about egg white’s curing anything):


The best domestic remedy for burns and scalds, always obtainable in emergencies, is the application of the white of an egg beaten to a foam and mixt with a tablespoonful of lard. If it is at hand, add five drops of carbolic acid to this. This is the best thing possible for immediate use.


However, it needs be pointed out that this same doctor immediately followed his “best domestic remedy” advice with this item about “the best thing possible for general treatment”:


If you want the best thing possible for general treatment, a dressing which will prevent scarring and give immediate relief, use one dram of bismuth subnitrate to an ounce of vaselin, with five drops of carbolic acid.


As to why slather egg white (or any other household item) onto burns rather than something more medically sound, said another physician in 1900:


As burns and scalds are usually emergency cases, we are not always prepared to adopt the most approved methods of treatment. We are compelled to select what we consider the best agents from such as are within our reach. Fortunately in every house we can generally find what will answer for temporary purposes. Carron oil, olive oil with the white of an egg, bicarbonate of soda in powder or saturated solution, or even flour may be utilized until we have time to get what we need.


In other words, egg white wasn’t being grabbed for as one of those secret home remedies that outperforms conventional medicine; it was merely what was at hand when the crisis occurred. And its use was to be temporary (with the implication that once the attending physician had full access to his medicines and treatments of choice, it would be quickly replaced with something far better).
If egg white is at all effective in treating burns (and we’re not at all convinced that it is, 100+ year medical references to the contrary), it’s as an occlusive dressing that would keep contamination out of a raw wound, not as a magical curative of burned flesh. Its effect on the healing process wouldn’t have anything to do with its collagen content or that it’s a “placenta full of vitamins,” but rather that it’s a thickish liquid that would form a barrier. (In other words, motor oil — which has no collagen to it at all — would work equally as well.)
As to what to do with all this confusion, even when the burn is minor and the injury is fully cooled before anything else is done to it, there is a downside to coating such an injury with egg white. Raw eggs sometimes contain or have resident on their shells salmonella, a deadly bacteria. Introducing salmonella into an open wound would be a dangerous idea. Says a physician friend of ours, “Burn-injured, denuded skin is an excellent culture medium, and a contaminated egg white applied to his burn could readily cause severe damage or death to the patient.”

# Anxiety Might Speed Alzheimer's: Study

By Amy Norton HealthDay Reporter

Older adults with memory problems may progress to Alzheimer's more quickly if they are also suffering from anxiety symptoms, a preliminary study suggests.

It's common for people with Alzheimer's disease to have mood symptoms, including anxiety and depression. And some research has suggested those symptoms can, in older people, act as early indicators of the dementia process.

The new study focused on 339 patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment -- persistent problems with memory and thinking skills that can progress to full-blown dementia.

But progression is not guaranteed, and people vary in how quickly their mental functioning declines.

There's no way to predict how things will go for any one person, said Dr. Maria Vittoria Spampinato, senior author on the study.

But researchers are trying to figure out whether certain factors are linked to the speed of progression. The new findings suggest anxiety might be one, according to Spampinato, a professor of radiology at the Medical University of South Carolina.

Her team found that patients with more anxiety symptoms at the outset were more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease over the next several years, compared to those with few symptoms.

Does that mean anxiety speeds up the dementia process? Not necessarily, according to Mary Sano, director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Mount Sinai in New York City.

Instead, anxiety is likely another symptom of the underlying brain disease, said Sano, who was not involved in the study.

She doubted that treating anxiety in someone with mild cognitive impairment would ""change the underlying biology"" of the dementia process.

Still, Sano said, recognizing anxiety in those patients is still important. For one, it might serve as a red flag that someone is at risk of more rapid decline.

That's key, Sano said, partly because anxiety symptoms are easy to measure. In this study, some other factors were linked to faster progression -- including shrinkage in certain brain areas. But that can only be gauged with a brain MRI.

Plus, Sano said, helping people cope with anxiety should be a goal in its own right. ""It's an important symptom to consider,"" she said.

The findings are based on a study of North American patients with mild cognitive impairment that involved memory problems. At the outset, all underwent anxiety and depression screening, MRI brain scans and blood tests.

Of 339 patients, 72 progressed to Alzheimer's over the next several years. Those with higher anxiety levels at the start tended to have a quicker progression -- as did patients with lower tissue volume in two brain areas involved in memory and learning.

Genes mattered, too: People carrying a gene variant linked to higher Alzheimer's risk -- ApoE4 -- also had a faster decline, compared to those with different variants.

Even with those other factors taken into account, though, anxiety was independently linked to a speedier progression, Spampinato said.

That alone, however, does not mean anxiety directly worsens cognitive problems.

""People living with mild cognitive impairment may experience anxiety, but what's unclear at this point is whether controlling or reducing anxiety may slow cognitive decline,"" said Heather Snyder, vice president of medical and scientific operations at the Alzheimer's Association.

She agreed with Sano on the importance of recognizing anxiety regardless.

""For individuals living with mild cognitive impairment or dementia,"" Snyder said, ""managing anxiety and stress is an important aspect of providing care.""

The Alzheimer's Association recommends some steps for patients and families: Simplify daily routines, make the home environment calm, and regularly fit in pleasant activities -- such as taking walks, gardening and listening to music.

Talking to a health care provider is always an option, too, Sano said.

""Sometimes older folks can be hesitant to talk about anxiety and depression,"" she noted. ""But I think that's a mistake.""

# Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Caused Coronavirus Cases in Minnesota

TUESDAY, Nov. 24, 2020 (HealthDay News) -- The Sturgis motorcycle rally held in South Dakota in August triggered a surge of coronavirus cases in Minnesota, a new study finds.

Before the rally, health officials expressed concern that it would cause new outbreaks, and these findings confirm that it did, CBS News reported.

After the event that attracted nearly half-million people, about one-third of counties in Minnesota had coronavirus cases linked to the rally, according to the study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Minnesota had 86 cases related to the rally, 51 people who went to the event and 35 who came into contact with those people later, state officials said.

Most of the patients didn't develop serious illness, but four were hospitalized and one died, CBS News reported.

# The Sturgis motorcycle rally in 2020 resulted in 250,000 COVID-19 coronavirus cases.

Was Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Responsible for 250K Coronavirus Cases?
A non-peer reviewed paper took off on the internet ... and then came the critics.
As governments fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Snopes is fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation, and you can help. Read our coronavirus fact checks. Submit any questionable rumors and “advice” you encounter. Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease.


In September 2020, social media was abuzz over a report from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics that linked 266,796 COVID-19 coronavirus cases (a figure that was reported as “more than 250,000” in various headlines) to the Sturgis motorcycle rally held in Sturgis, South Dakota:

IZA Institute of Labor Economics truly did publish a paper estimating that the rally was linked to a surge of approximately 250,000 COVID-19 cases (representing a cost of $12.2 billion). However, while the rally likely contributed to a rise in coronavirus cases, the figures stated here are estimates from a non-peer reviewed paper and have not been demonstrated definitively. Furthermore, various statisticians and epidemiologists have indicated the study had some flaws. 
Before we get to the expert opinions on this study, let’s dispel a few quick rumors on social media. This study did not claim, for instance, that 250,000 people tested positive for COVID-19 shortly after attending the rally. The research attempted to quantify how many cases of COVID-19 could potentially be linked to people who attended the rally, traveled to other locations, and then spread the disease among their communities. 
It should also be noted that this is an estimate based on a wide variety of factors, not an actual headcount of COVID-19 patients who attended, or knew someone who attended, the rally. As mentioned above, this study was not peer-reviewed and was prefaced with a piece of text noting that “IZA Discussion Papers often represent preliminary work and are circulated to encourage discussion.”
The IZA paper’s finding that 250,000 COVID-19 cases were linked to the Sturgis rally was based on three key factors: anonymized smartphone data that showed an influx of out-of-state visitors and a sharp increase in foot traffic at “restaurants and bars, hotels, entertainment venues, and retail establishments”; a decrease in stay-at-home activity in the surrounding area; and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data that showed COVID-19 cases increased both in South Dakota where the rally was held, and in areas where Sturgis attendees traveled to in the days after the rally.
While this study may provide a broad estimate on how Sturgis could have impacted the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of epidemiologists and statisticians have taken issue with models used in the study and the report’s findings. 
Joshua Clayton, South Dakota’s state epidemiologist, said that the study’s findings did “not align with what we know” and argued that IZA did not account for other contributing factors, such as the fact that schools reopened around the same time as the rally.
Local news outlet KEVN reported:
“From what we know the results do not align with what we know,” state epidemiologist Joshua Clayton said.
He mentioned that a white paper isn’t peer-reviewed. And pointed out the paper doesn’t note schools in the state also reopened close after the Rally ended, which could have attributed to the surge of cases in South Dakota.
Rex Douglas, the director of the Machine Learning for Social Science Lab (MSSL), Center for Peace and Security Studies, University of California San Diego, and Kevin Griffin, an assistant professor at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine, also took issue with the methodology used in this paper. Griffin, for instance, noted that cases were already on the rise when the rally took place, while Douglas noted that authorities simply don’t have the data to reach such a precise conclusion. 
Douglas wrote:
They want to know if mass-events (protests, conventions, rallies) spread covid. But we don’t have individual level data on attendees and comparable stay-homes. So they resort to a diff-in-diff, looking to see if a place has more, less, or the same number of confirmed cases soon after an event than they ‘should.’ The argument is that the trend line for an entire location after time T can tell us if what happened on T is safe or risky.
For why this research design does not answer that question, imagine running your own experiment. Go outside and cough in a stranger’s face right now. Now if next week your county’s confirmed case rate goes up, that’s bad behavior, stays the same it’s ok, and goes down it’s good!
Jennifer Beam Dowd, the deputy director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford, also took issue with the paper’s conclusion in an article published on Slate. Generally speaking, Dowd argued that the researchers made assumptions that don’t always play out in reality. More specifically, Dowd took issue with how the study confidently presented a precise conclusion (266,796 COVID-cases) despite noisy results. 
The 266,796 number also overstates the precision of the estimates in the paper even if the model is taken at face value. The confidence intervals for the “high inflow” counties seem to include zero (meaning the authors can’t say with statistical confidence that there was any difference in infections across counties due to the rally). No standard errors (measures of the variability around the estimate) are provided for the main regression results, and many of the p-values for key results are not statistically significant at conventional levels. So even if one believes the design and assumptions, the results are very “noisy” and subject to caveats that don’t merit the broadcasting of the highly specific 266,796 figure with confidence, though I imagine that “somewhere between zero and 450,000 infections” would not have been as headline-grabbing.
The claim that 250,000 COVID-19 cases were linked to Sturgis is based on one study’s estimate of how the motorcycle rally could have impacted the pandemic. As several statisticians and epidemiologists have noted, the models used for this study contained flaws, and the report arrived at a conclusion that was more precise than the available data would have allowed.";yes;neutral;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;yes;contradicting;The article explains that the claim is based on a non-peer-reviewed study with methodological flaws and that experts have criticized the study's conclusions, suggesting that the precise number of 250,000 cases linked to the rally is unreliable.;1851;497

# Men with 'the Celtic gene' are 11 times more likely to develop liver cancer, study finds

Men who have at least two copies of 'the Celtic gene' are 11 times more likely to be diagnosed with liver cancer, a study has found.

The gene, which is a mutation on the p.C282Y gene, is so nicknamed because it's found most commonly in people with Celtic British heritage.

It causes a condition called haemochromatosis, which is an unhealthy build-up of iron in the blood, which scientists say increases the risk of liver cancer.

More than seven per cent of men who had the faulty gene developed the life-threatening condition by the age of 75 in a study, while the rate in the general population was just 0.6 per cent.

Scientists said up to 175,000 men and boys in Britain have inherited the genes from their European ancestors.

Women carry the gene as well but the study found they did not face an increased cancer risk in the study, and they also suffer less from haemochromatosis.

Warning signs that someone has the Celtic gene include tiredness, muscle weakness and joint pain, and it can be diagnosed through a quick blood test.

People who carry it are told to drink less alcohol than the Government's 14 units a week limit to limit liver damage, and to get their blood treated regularly to remove excess concentrations of the element.

This graph from the study paper shows how common liver cancer was in people with two copies of the Celtic gene, broken down by age (blue line), and how common it was in those without the gene (yellow line)

Scientists from the University of Exeter analysed information about 1,294 men with at least one Celtic gene from England, Scotland and Wales, using data stored in the UK Biobank.

Twenty-one of these men developed liver cancer over the nine-year period examined, and 14 of them died from the disease.

WHAT IS HAEMO-CHROMATOSIS? Haemochromatosis is an inherited condition in which iron levels in the body slowly build up over many years. This build-up of iron, known as iron overload, can cause unpleasant symptoms. If it isn't treated, this can damage parts of the body such as the liver, joints, pancreas and heart. Haemochromatosis most often affects people of white northern European background and is particularly common in countries where lots of people have a Celtic background, such as Ireland, Scotland and Wales, hence its nickname of the 'Celtic curse'. The genetic mutation that causes the condition is carried by 250,000 people in the UK and around 1million in the US. Symptoms include fatigue, weight loss and joint pain. However, the condition can also cause erectile dysfunction in men and irregular periods in women. Although haemochromatosis itself will not kill someone or make them seriously ill, if it's not treated the excess build-up of iron can lead to more dangerous complications such as permanent liver damage or cancer, diabetes, arthritis or heart failure. Source: NHS Choices Advertisement

The figures were adjusted to project the risk of developing the disease among those who had at least two copies of the gene to give the 7.2 per cent figure.

The scientists also followed 1,596 women with the genes, but found the genes did not significantly impact their risk of developing liver cancer.

The scientists said this may be because women lose iron when they menstruate and during childbirth, therefore it is less likely to build to harmful levels in their bodies, although some do still develop haemochromatosis.

The work was published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA.

Professor David Melzer, a public health expert who led the research, said: 'Tragically, men with haemochromatosis faulty gene have been dying of liver cancer for many years, but this was thought to be rare.

'The large scale of the UK Biobank study allowed us to measure cancer risk accurately.

'We were shocked to find that more than seven per cent of men with two faulty genes are likely to develop liver cancer by age 75, particularly considering that the UK has the second highest rate of these faulty genes in the world.'

He added: 'Fortunately most of these cancers could be prevented with early treatment. Blood donations made during routine treatment of haemochromatosis can be used for other patients, so early diagnosis would actually be a win-win for the NHS.'

Excess iron is stored by liver when it cannot be used by the body and the chemical – which is a heavy metal – is known to be toxic in high concentrations.

It has been seen to directly damage DNA, which can lead to mutations or cell death, and may also block tumour-suppressing genes which help to weed out early genetic errors that can develop into cancers.

The scientists said their results suggested diagnostic tests should be carried out earlier to detect those who have the faulty genes.

Above is a scan showing the liver and a cancerous growth inside it. This was taken from Cassidy Armstrong, 36, from the US, who thought she was facing a 'death sentence' when the watermelon-sized tumour was identified

WHAT IS LIVER CANCER? Figures show almost 6,000 Britons and 33,000 Americans are diagnosed with liver cancer every year. The killer disease is often difficult to treat because it can be hard to spot at an early stage, when it causes few noticeable symptoms. Many patients miss out on life-saving surgery because they aren't diagnosed with the disease until it has already spread. Instead, they receive chemotherapy and other similar treatments to slow down its progression. Five-year survival rates are as low as six per cent. Common symptoms are jaundice, loss of appetite, unintentional weight loss, bouts of vomiting, itchy skin and fatigue, the NHS says. Half of cases are considered preventable. Drinking too much alcohol, being overweight and smoking are all linked to the disease. Advertisement

Dr Janice Atkins, research fellow at the University of Exeter and first author of the paper, warned the faulty genes are 'relatively common' in people with European ancestry.

'Unfortunately, haemochromatosis is often diagnosed too late,' she said. 'Earlier diagnosis could prevent so much unnecessary disease.'

A study published in the British Medical Journal last year warned that the faulty genes quadruple the risk of someone developing liver disease.

The researchers found that in men, who are at twice the risk of women, 1.6 per cent of all hip replacements and 5.8 per cent of all liver cancers were down to haemochromatosis.

Liver cancer sometimes doesn't cause symptoms until it is in the late stages and difficult to treat, meaning it is difficult to diagnose early on.

It was revealed last year that deaths from the illness had surged by 50 per cent in ten years, and were rising faster than those from any other type of disease.

There were 5,700 deaths from the cancer in 2017, according to Cancer Research UK, a marked surge from the 3,200 deaths caused by the condition ten years ago.

Cancer Research UK's liver cancer expert, Professor Helen Reeves at Newcastle University, said at the time: 'Unfortunately, progress in treating liver cancer has been painfully slow and we desperately need more options for patients.

'Another problem is the rise in the number of people being diagnosed, which has meant we are losing more people to this disease than ever before.

'Rising levels of obesity and associated conditions like diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have likely had a big role in this, although they aren't the only factors.'";"(2019-12-13)

# Not losing weight on keto? Here’s why

(Natural News)
 Originally developed in the 1920s, the ketogenic diet has increased in popularity in recent years as a weight-management method.
A popular diet among athletes and fitness enthusiasts, the ketogenic diet aims to make the body enter a metabolic state called ketosis. While in ketosis, the body uses stored fats as its primary energy source. This, experts say, is what causes keto dieters to experience dramatic reductions in weight.
However, some individuals have reported difficulties losing weight while on the keto diet. Here are some possible reasons why: (Related: 5 Tips for a successful keto diet.)
Eating too many carbohydrates
As noted by dietitians, one major reason a person does not lose weight while on the keto diet is that he has not achieved ketosis. This happens when the dieter does not cut back enough on carbohydrates, which should be limited to only five to 10 percent of his calorie intake.
According to adherents of the keto diet, limiting your carbohydrate intake to no more than 30 grams a day is enough to make your body enter the state of ketosis. However, while a person may feel as if he has drastically reduced his carbohydrate intake, he may still be consuming large amounts of the nutrient, thus preventing his body from burning its fat stores.
Eating too much protein
Another thing that can prevent the body from going into ketosis is consuming too much protein.
Many people mistakenly think that the ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-protein diet. But eating plenty of protein-rich foods is counterproductive because excess proteins can be broken down into amino acids, which can then be used to create glucose.
For people on the keto diet, experts recommend getting most of your calories from healthy fats, which, ideally, should represent a whopping 60 percent of your total calorie intake. Eating this much fat leaves little room for protein, which should comprise only 35 percent of your daily diet.
Not counting calories
Another reason why someone on the keto diet isn’t losing weight is because he is eating more calories than his body can burn. High intake of calories can prevent the body from experiencing any benefits, despite being in a state of ketosis.
According to experts, fatty foods contain more calories than foods that are high in carbohydrates and proteins. Followers of the keto diet are therefore advised to keep track of the number of calories they consume, lest they end up negating the weight-reducing effects of ketosis.
Drinking too much alcohol
Those on the keto diet may drink alcohol, provided it is low in carbohydrates, such as gin and vodka. However, care must be taken to not overindulge in these drinks, as they are very calorie-dense.
As noted by dietitians, overindulging in these alcoholic drinks can prevent keto dieters from losing weight.
Engaging in little to no exercise
People who claim that the keto diet is doing nothing for their weight often forget that they need to combine the diet with regular physical activity.
Exercise, besides healthy eating, is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. This is especially true for people who are on the keto diet as regular exercise promotes a faster metabolism and helps the body burn more calories.
That said, here are some tips that can help you avoid the pitfalls that come with adopting new eating habits like the ketogenic diet:

Start keeping a food journal. A food journal or food diary can help you track your food intake so you won’t exceed your daily allowance of certain foods or nutrients.
Stay hydrated. Water can help fill up the stomach, preventing you from overeating throughout the day. In addition, water helps flush out waste from the body, cleaning it from the inside out.
Get at least six hours of sleep. A healthy sleep cycle allows the body to reset and helps reduce stress levels. Stress, according to experts, may lead to excessive weight gain if not addressed promptly.

Healthy weight management and sensible weight loss can be achieved not just by adopting strict diets such as the keto diet, but by making — and maintaining — healthy changes to your overall lifestyle.

# Construction worker died after fall from ladder – why was his death blamed on COVID?

(Natural News)
 A 51-year-old Croatian man fell off a ladder and died in a workplace accident, but his cause of death may surprise you. It wasn’t the impact of the fall or brain damage that was ultimately listed as his cause of death – it was coronavirus.
This is according to the Journal of Forensic Pathology, who reports that the man fell off a 10-foot ladder while working on a home as part of his construction job. His external injuries were minor, including cuts and bruises, but he also experienced a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is an often-fatal condition that entails bleeding in the space between the brain and the tissues covering the brain. The man was declared dead at the scene of the accident.
However, the autopsy also found that significant portions of his lungs were blocked. This led scientists to conclude that he had suffered from the life-threatening Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, or ARDS, that some COVID-19 patients are experiencing.
The Journal reported that the man had been complaining of a respiratory-like illness during the days leading up to the accident. He had complained of symptoms such as fatigue, cough, fever, headache and shortness of breath but decided against seeing a doctor.
In a post-mortem test, he tested positive for coronavirus, and the Journal wrote that his death was ruled as natural and caused by COVID-19 rather than the deadly fall. The doctors explained that because the illness stops air from flowing into the lungs, it could have caused his fall. Under World Health Organization guidelines, his death must be recorded as a COVID-19 fatality.
Some hospitals have a financial incentive to attribute deaths to COVID
Some state health departments in the U.S. have been coaching doctors to list COVID-19 as the cause of death in patients even if it was only suspected and the patient was not even tested.
In fact, one County Health Officer in California, Gail Newell, said: “If anyone that has a COVID diagnosis dies, it automatically feeds into the database as a COVID death, even if it wasn’t a COVID death. For example, a 25-year-old dies in a motorcycle accident and then our coroner finds out that he incidentally did have COVID at the time, the state counts that as a COVID death, although he clearly died in a motorcycle accident.”
Unfortunately, there is a major financial motivation for hospitals to pad the numbers of people who are dying from the virus. San Jose naturopathic physician Tim O’Shea said that while MediCal pays $4,600 for a pneumonia diagnosis, that jumps to around $39,000 if the patient also tests positive for COVID.
This may also explain why a man who was killed in a deadly Florida motorcycle crash was also listed as a COVID-19 death in the state. When FOX 35 News questioned Orange County Health Officer Dr. Raul Pino about whether two people in their 20s listed as coronavirus deaths had underlying conditions, he responded that one had none and had actually died in a motorcycle accident, raising a lot of questions about how COVID-19 deaths are being reported there. The doctor went on to say that it could be argued that the COVID-19 actually caused him to crash.
These stories just go to show how hard it is to trust the numbers when it comes to COVID-19. Of course it’s a deadly disease that we should all take seriously and do our best to avoid, but dying with COVID is far, far different from dying from COVID, and that is an important distinction that should be made to paint a more accurate picture of what we are dealing with.

# Do you have high cholesterol or triglycerides? Check your vitamin D levels

(Natural News)
 Cholesterol levels are an important marker of cardiovascular health. While your body needs cholesterol to build healthy cells, high levels of it can increase your risk of heart disease. Cholesterol is a fatty substance. If it accumulates in your blood vessels, it can restrict blood flow and form blood clots, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.
Your total cholesterol levels consist of the amount of triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in your blood. Triglycerides and LDL cholesterol can accumulate in your body and clog your blood vessels. Meanwhile, HDL cholesterol helps protect you from heart disease.
One factor that may affect cholesterol levels is vitamin D deficiency. In a study published in the journal Nutrition Reviews, study author Daniel Dibaba of the University of Kentucky and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center found that people with vitamin D deficiency improved their cholesterol levels upon taking vitamin D supplements.
Vitamin D improves cholesterol levels

Previous studies have linked vitamin?D deficiency to heart attacks, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, stroke and other conditions associated with cardiovascular disease, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Other studies have also suggested that vitamin?D may have a beneficial effect on one’s cholesterol profile and cardiovascular health.
To evaluate these findings, Dibaba analyzed 41 randomized controlled trials that examined the effect of vitamin?D supplementation on cholesterol levels. The studies involved more than 3,400 participants, half of whom took vitamin D supplements while the remaining half took a placebo. A quarter of the trials had follow-up periods of over six months.
Dibaba found that the volunteers who took vitamin D supplements significantly reduced their total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and maintained healthy HDL cholesterol levels. These improvements, according to the Dibaba, were more pronounced in the participants with vitamin D deficiency. (Related: Magnesium and vitamin D: The perfect pair?)
 “Vitamin?D supplementation may be useful in hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) patients with vitamin?D insufficiency who are at high risk of cardiovascular diseases,” wrote Dibaba.

Prevent vitamin D deficiency
Vitamin D deficiency is an important health issue in the U.S. Around 56 percent of Caucasian infants and 35 percent of American adults have vitamin D deficiency.
Your body produces vitamin D when you’re exposed to sunlight. But the increased use of sunscreen and spending less time outdoors can affect how much vitamin D is produced by your body.
Other factors that lead to lower vitamin D levels include: (h/t to HopkinsMedicine.org)

Obesity and being overweight – Fat cells absorb vitamin D and keep it from circulating throughout the bloodstream.
Dark skin – People with dark skin have a built-in natural sunscreen in melanin, which prevents the skin from synthesizing vitamin D.
Sex – Women tend to have lower vitamin D levels than men. That’s because women have more body fat and often spend more time indoors. Women also tend to wear hats and sunscreen more often than men.
Age – As you get older, your body absorbs less vitamin D from your diet and produces less vitamin D in the skin.
Location – Areas farther away from the equator don’t receive enough sunlight from November to February.

Take vitamin D supplements and eat more foods rich in vitamin D to prevent vitamin D deficiency. These foods include fatty fish, fortified orange juice, egg yolk, liver, cereal and milk. If you’re taking supplements, the recommended daily amount of vitamin D is 400 international units (IU) for children up to 12 months of age, 600 IU for ages 1 to 70 years and 800 IU for adults over 70 years.

One factor that may affect cholesterol levels is vitamin D deficiency. In a study published in the journal Nutrition Reviews, study author Daniel Dibaba of the University of Kentucky and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center found that people with vitamin D deficiency improved their cholesterol levels upon taking vitamin D supplements.
Vitamin D improves cholesterol levels

Previous studies have linked vitamin?D deficiency to heart attacks, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, stroke and other conditions associated with cardiovascular disease, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Other studies have also suggested that vitamin?D may have a beneficial effect on one’s cholesterol profile and cardiovascular health.
To evaluate these findings, Dibaba analyzed 41 randomized controlled trials that examined the effect of vitamin?D supplementation on cholesterol levels. The studies involved more than 3,400 participants, half of whom took vitamin D supplements while the remaining half took a placebo. A quarter of the trials had follow-up periods of over six months.
Dibaba found that the volunteers who took vitamin D supplements significantly reduced their total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and maintained healthy HDL cholesterol levels. These improvements, according to the Dibaba, were more pronounced in the participants with vitamin D deficiency. (Related: Magnesium and vitamin D: The perfect pair?)
 “Vitamin?D supplementation may be useful in hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) patients with vitamin?D insufficiency who are at high risk of cardiovascular diseases,” wrote Dibaba.

Prevent vitamin D deficiency
Vitamin D deficiency is an important health issue in the U.S. Around 56 percent of Caucasian infants and 35 percent of American adults have vitamin D deficiency.
Your body produces vitamin D when you’re exposed to sunlight. But the increased use of sunscreen and spending less time outdoors can affect how much vitamin D is produced by your body.
Other factors that lead to lower vitamin D levels include: (h/t to HopkinsMedicine.org)

Obesity and being overweight – Fat cells absorb vitamin D and keep it from circulating throughout the bloodstream.
Dark skin – People with dark skin have a built-in natural sunscreen in melanin, which prevents the skin from synthesizing vitamin D.
Sex – Women tend to have lower vitamin D levels than men. That’s because women have more body fat and often spend more time indoors. Women also tend to wear hats and sunscreen more often than men.
Age – As you get older, your body absorbs less vitamin D from your diet and produces less vitamin D in the skin.
Location – Areas farther away from the equator don’t receive enough sunlight from November to February.

Take vitamin D supplements and eat more foods rich in vitamin D to prevent vitamin D deficiency. These foods include fatty fish, fortified orange juice, egg yolk, liver, cereal and milk. If you’re taking supplements, the recommended daily amount of vitamin D is 400 international units (IU) for children up to 12 months of age, 600 IU for ages 1 to 70 years and 800 IU for adults over 70 years.

# Moderna's covid vaccine may NOT block covid-positive from spreading it

Moderna's vaccine may not prevent people who catch coronavirus from spreading it to others, the firm's chief scientist has admitted.

But Tal Zaks added that he does 'believe' the shot will do so - trials just haven't tested that yet in a recent https Axios interview.

He urged Americans not to 'over-interpret' the vaccine's promising trial results, which showed it is 94.5 percent effective at preventing people from getting sick from coronavirus.

Neither Pfizer nor Moderna used methods in their vaccine trials that allow them say for sure if their shots prevent transmission.

Although its trials are still ongoing, early data released Monday by AstraZeneca suggests that the vaccine it developed with Oxford University might in fact prevent viral spread.

Moderna knows its vaccine can prevent illness from coronavirus, but its trials did not reveal whether the shot stops people from becoming asymptomatic spreaders

'Our results show that this vaccine can prevent you from being sick, it can prevent you from being severely sick,' Zaks told Axios.

'They do not show that this vaccine can prevent you from potentially transiently carrying the virus transiently and infecting others.'

Like most vaccines, Moderna's does not kill the virus if you inhale it, so the shot itself is not eliminating the virus.

Instead, it is designed with the intent of preventing the virus from latching onto receptors on human cells that let the virus weasel its way into those cells.

Viruses exist in a weird sort of purgatory between being living and non-living things. Unlike more complicated human cells, viruses can't make their own energy.

Instead, they have to hijack the machinery of human or animal cells, pirating that energy and allowing the virus to make copies of itself.

Without getting into our cells and taking them over for its own purposes, the virus can't replicate.

And a lower viral load generally means that the virus is less likely to be potent enough to infect someone else.

But Moderna hasn't proven that.

According to Science Magazine, Pfizer and Moderna only tested trial members who developed potential symptoms of COVID-19 symptoms for the virus.

Without knowing of others members of the trials might have been asymptomatic spreaders, there was no way to say for sure whether the vaccine prevented them from infecting others.

'When we start the deployment of this vaccine we will not have sufficient concrete data to prove that this vaccine reduces transmission,' Zaks said.

'Do I believe that it prevents transmission? Absolutely, yes, but I saw this because of the science.

'But absent proof I think it's important we don't change behaviors solely on the basis of vaccination,' Zaks added, suggesting that Americans continue to use non-medical methods like mask wearing and social distancing to stem the spread of coronavirus.

Moderna will continue to collect data if and when its shot gets emergency authorization. This additional data may tell the company if its shot can prevent the virus from spreading.

Oxford University and AstraZeneca had all trial participants swab themselves at home, allowing it to test whether the vaccine was preventing people from having transmissible coronavirus, or just preventing the virus from making them sick.

Its trials are ongoing, but the company said Monday that data looks promising that the shot may prevent spread.";"(2019-12-13)

# Coronavirus 'could be STOPPED if 70% wore surgical face masks'

The coronavirus pandemic could be curbed if at least 70 percent of the public wore masks, a new study suggests.

Researchers looked at the physics of difference face coverings, including their material and designs.

They found that the three most common types of face masks - N95s, surgical masks and face masks - help lower reproduction (Rt) rates, meaning less people are being infected due to social distancing.

However, the team also found that only N95s were the most effective at filtering tiny infectious particles that can hang in the air for extended periods and burrow deep into the lungs.

A new study found N95s were best for filtering out aerosol-sized droplets, which can remain suspended in the air for long periods of time

For the study, published in the journal Physics of Fluids, the team looked at research on face masks and how they filter or block the virus.

They analyzed how masks protect against fluid droplets that are expelled when a person coughs, sneezes, sings or even breathes.

Larger droplets, which range between five to 10 microns - about seven times smaller than the diameter of a human hair - are the most common.

However, smaller droplets are perhaps more dangerous because they can become aerosolized and remain suspended in the air for long amounts of time.

Among the three types of masks studies - N95s, surgical masks, cloths masks - solely N95s were found to filter out aerosol-sized droplets.

Researchers found that found masks made of hybrid polymer materials can filter particles and also cool the face.

This means using a mix of material for a face covering such as cotton, polyester, chiffon, silk, flannel.

When multiple layers were used, and a combination of different fabrics, it allows for best filtration and for heat to escape.

'There could be some relation between breathing resistance and the flow resistance of the face mask which will need to be studied for a face mask-wearing interval,' said said Dr Heow Pueh Lee, an associate professor of applied mechanics at the National University of Singapore.

'Also, the environmental condition in the compartmental space within the face mask will need to be more accurately quantified using miniaturized sensors and the development of human replicas for such studies

The study also found that regular use of face masks drop the Rt rate below 1.0.

'The results suggest that the consistent use of efficient face masks, such as surgical masks, could lead to the eradication of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents use such masks in public consistently,' said author Sanjay Kumar, an assistant professor of engineering as UC Berkeley.

'Even less efficient cloth masks could also slow the spread if worn consistently.'

It comes after former FDA commissioner Dr Scott Gottlieb wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, in which he encouraged American to buy better masks

Specifically he recommended the N95, or its equivalent, due to its proven ability to block at least 95 percent. of small particles

Gottlieb said the next best option is a surgical mask and, if nothing else is available, to buy cloth masks made from cotton-polyester blends.";"(2020-06-19)
# A Facebook post is correct in saying N95 masks, surgical masks, and cloth masks can be dangerous and/or ineffective in protecting against the spread of COVID-19 based on U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines.

Are These Claims About the Effectiveness of Face Masks True?
A widely shared Facebook post from June 2020, purportedly citing the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, offered numerous claims but little evidence.
Another day, another viral claim about the effectiveness (or not) of face masks amidst the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic of 2020. A popular Facebook post that had been copied and pasted numerous times in June repeated spurious but familiar claims about masks, this time selectively citing U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) recommendations:

The lengthy post focused on three different types of protective masks: N95 masks, surgical masks, and cloth masks. We tackle assertions about each one below. 
N95 Masks
According to this post your unfiltered, potentially infectious breath could harm others if you are breathing through an N95 respirator.
N95 masks: are designed for CONTAMINATED environments. That means when you exhale through N95 the design is that you are exhaling into contamination. The exhale from N95 masks are vented to breath straight out without filtration. They don’t filter the air on the way out. They don’t need to.
Conclusion: if you’re in Stewart’s and the guy with Covid has N95 mask his covid breath is unfiltered being exhaled into Stewart’s (because it was designed for already contaminated environments, it’s not filtering your air on the way out)
This is mostly true, except it only applies to N95 respirators with valves. Such masks were designed for construction/factory workers or miners, to keep out dust and other particles, but not to prevent infectious particles from leaving the mask. When the wearer inhales, the one-way valve closes so pathogens can’t get through, but when the user exhales, the valve opens. In May, the San Francisco Department of Public Health tweeted that N95 masks with valves in the front weren’t safe and “may actually propel your germs further.”
Hospitals largely use N95 masks without valves for this reason, and in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations. OSHA’s guidelines on N95s primarily focus on how they are meant “to prevent workers from inhaling small particles, including airborne transmissible or aerosolized infectious agents,” and should be required in workplaces where respirators are needed.
Surgical Masks
The Facebook post argues that wearing a surgical mask makes you a “walking virus dispenser,” as follows:
Surgical Mask: these masks were designed and approved for STERILE environments. The amount of particles and contaminants in the outside and indoor environments where people are CLOGG these masks very Very quickly. The moisture from your breath combined with the clogged mask will render it “useless” IF you come in contact with Covid and your mask traps it You become a walking virus dispenser. Everytime you put your mask on you are breathing the germs from EVERYWHERE you went. They should be changed or thrown out every “20-30 minutes in a non sterile environment”
OSHA guidelines seem to contradict some of these claims, arguing that surgical masks protect workers “against [potentially infectious] splashes and sprays,” and also “contain” the wearer’s respiratory droplets to protect others. OSHA says these masks should be placed on sick individuals to prevent transmission via droplets. Surgical masks do, however, offer ineffective protection from transmission via airborne particles due to their loose fit. While the post argues that such masks should be thrown out every 20-30 minutes, OSHA simply recommends that they “should be properly disposed of after use.”
Cloth Masks
The Facebook post’s claims about cloth masks are mostly false and have been debunked by Snopes before. The author claims:
Cloth masks: today three people pointed to their masks as the walked by me entering Lowe’s. They said “ya gotta wear your mask BRO” I said very clearly “those masks don’t work bro, in fact they MAKE you sicker” the “pshh’d” me.
By now hopefully you all know CLOTH masks do not filter anything … ALL of them offer NO FILTERING whatsoever. As you exhale you are ridding your lungs of contaminants and carbon dioxide. Cloth masks trap this carbon dioxide the best. It actually risks health. The moisture caught in these masks can become mildew ridden over night. Dry coughing, enhanced allergies, sore throat are all symptoms of a micro-mold in your mask.
OSHA guidelines already state that cloth masks are ineffective filters against airborne particles. They are worn to protect other people from risk of infection via respiratory droplets. People wearing them are in little to no danger of breathing in unhealthy amounts of carbon dioxide. The post points out the danger of dirty masks, which is why both OSHA and CDC recommend washing cloth masks after use.
OSHA also “generally recommends that employers encourage workers to wear face coverings at work,” contradicting the argument of this entire post. 
Finally, the author of the post claimed to be “OSHA 10&30 certified,” which refers to OSHA’s 10-hour and 30-hour training modules about common health and safety hazards in the workplace. We reached out to OSHA, and a representative told us that these courses “do not include COVID-19 topics,” nor does OSHA “certify” trainers.
In sum, the varied claims in this viral post (with their dubious origins) for the most part misrepresented information provided by OSHA. Scientific wisdom argues that wearing a mask is more effective than doing nothing, and, combined with social distancing and other safety measures, offers protection not only to the wearer but to others. Given this post’s combination of only a few correct facts and largely incorrect conclusions, we rate its various claims as “Mostly False.”";no;supporting;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;yes;contradicting;The article contradicts the claim by providing evidence that masks, including N95s, surgical masks, and cloth masks, are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and supporting their use in public settings.;2083;70

# Coronavirus UK: Sussex and Herefordshire cases soar as Tiers decided

Advertisement

An interactive module has today revealed how quickly coronavirus outbreaks are growing in every local authority in England as millions wait for Boris Johnson to declare which areas will be subject to Tier Three restrictions when the second national lockdown ends next week.

As Britain approached Autumn only five of around 200 local authorities had a weekly Covid-19 infection rate above 100 cases per 100,000 people. Only 24 areas still have an infection rate that is in the double figures.

East Sussex, Herefordshire and Milton Keynes were the local authorities in England that suffered the biggest spikes in coronavirus cases during the most recent week, making them among the most likely to enter Tier Three rules that force restaurants to move to takeaway only.

Public Health England statistics show infection rates — the number of new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people — shot up by at least 50 per cent in all three areas in the seven-day spell ending November 15. Kent, parts of Essex and London also saw large rises, according to the data MailOnline has used to make an interactive tool.

Meanwhile, the areas that saw the greatest falls in cases were almost all in Tier Three in the North West, adding further evidence that the local lockdown system appears to work. Warrington, Oldham, Wigan and Blackburn, all of which suffered huge numbers of infections during England's second wave, saw declines of 30 per cent or more.

Boris Johnson last night confirmed the country's second draconian lockdown will end on December 2, with No10 opting to return to a revamped three-tier system that could have to remain in place until at least March 31 — more than a year after the first lockdown began.

Ministers are waiting for the most up-to-date data to decide what brackets individual authorities will be placed in, with the breakdown set to be published on Thursday. Policymakers will analyse rates of infections, test positivity and speed of outbreak growth to decide on the measures.

The worst-hit areas including Hull and the North West are expected to be placed under the toughest Tier Three, which forces restaurants and pubs to shut — unless they offer takeaways.

Debate rages on over which bracket London should be in, with the capital's mayor Sadiq Khan predicting the city will face Tier Two — which bans mixing indoors with other households. But senior Tories including Sir Iain Duncan Smith last night demanded the city, the beating heart of the UK's economy, is put under Tier One.

Northern mayors have voiced opposition to plans to put them into higher tiers, with Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham saying they could trigger 'widespread business failure' in the region. MPs have warned T2 and T3 will be 'catastrophic' for businesses and spark a damaging new mutiny.

Whitehall sources told the Daily Mail last night that very few areas would be afforded Tier One restrictions, with only the rural regions — such as Cornwall and South Oxfordshire — likely to see the lightest rules applied.

Britain today recorded 11,299 Covid-19 cases in the lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks, but deaths rose again to 608 which is the highest toll since May.

‹ Slide me › Above are infections before winter in September (right) and those on November 18 (left) after the second lockdown

Covid-19 cases have fallen across most of the North of England since lockdown was imposed, but they are rising in a corner of the South East. The percentage change is based on comparing data from the week ending November 15 to the week ending November 8. It comes as the Government prepares to unveil its tier system

The onerous tiered system will be in place across England from December 3 until the end of March, the Prime Minister said

COVID RESTRICTIONS WILL BE EASED OVER CHRISTMAS FOR FIVE DAYS, OFFICIALS CONFIRM Coronavirus restrictions will be eased across the UK for five days at Christmas to allow up to three households to meet indoors after the four home nations agreed a joint plan to loosen draconian curbs over the festive period. A four-nation meeting of the Cobra emergency committee agreed the proposals this afternoon. The relaxed measures will be in place from Wednesday December 23 to Sunday December 27, paving the way for families in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to meet up. It came after Nicola Sturgeon had earlier suggested the Christmas respite from coronavirus lockdown would not be entirely the same in Scotland. The First Minister said she hoped there would be an agreement on a 'common framework' for the festive season. But she hinted at splits between the nations saying the 'precise definition of household' is likely to vary. Scotland currently has different rules on gatherings compared to England, including not including under-12s in limits on numbers. Meanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has admitted that loosening the restrictions over Christmas will inevitably lead to more cases of the deadly disease. Frantic efforts have been going on for days to find a joint position for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to allow some kind of family Christmas. Advertisement

Sir Jeremy Farrar, from the Wellcome Trust and a member of SAGE, said there was enough data for Britain to lockdown in January;

Today 11,299 Covid-19 cases were recorded in the lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks, but deaths rose to 608 in highest toll since May.

The Prime Minister warned last night: 'We expect more regions to fall, at least temporally, into higher levels than before but by using these tougher tiers and by using rapid turnaround tests on an ever greater scale to drive R below one.'

But he added the toughened tiers should make it possible for local authorities 'to move down the tier-ing scale to lower levels of restrictions' as cases start to plummet.

The previous system was heavily criticised for putting areas into Tier Three and then seemingly giving them no clear-cut way out of the curbs.

Toughest restrictions are likely to be applied to areas with the highest infection rates as well as those that have been growing the fastest in recent weeks.

Public Health England data shows a North-South divide that is seeing positive rates increasing faster in parts of the South of the country and in London, while rates are highest – but falling fastest – in the North.

This is likely a legacy of the original three-tier system which saw much of Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire thrust into the toughest local rules before the national lockdown while much of the South didn't have any at all.

North Lincolnshire was the only part of the country further north than the Midlands that featured in the top 20 places with the fastest rate of increase in the week up to November 15. The data counts positive test results that came through the Department of Health's official testing programme.

Ten of the top 20 were boroughs of London – Greenwich, Enfield, Merton, Croydon, Havering, Camden, Hammersmith & Fulham, Bromley, Kingston upon Thames and Hackney & the City of London.

Other areas that saw their positive case counts increase by 25 per cent or more in a week were East Sussex, Herefordshire, Milton Keynes, Kent, Medway, Southend-on-Sea, Slough, North Lincolnshire, Bedford and Cornwall.

Meanwhile, 17 out of the 20 areas that saw the biggest falls in their infection rates during the same week were all ones that were in Tier Three, with the exception only of Torbay in Devon, North East Lincolnshire and Derby.

WHAT ARE THE NEW TIER RULES? Tier One will be the default and measures will not be allowed to get more relaxed in any part of England: Rule of six and social distancing apply to gatherings indoors and outdoors;

Pubs and restaurants are allowed to open with table service only and an 11pm closing time. Tier Two: People from separate households cannot meet indoors and the rule of six applies outside;

Pubs must close unless operating as restaurants, with alcoholic drinks served alongside meals; Tier Three will be the toughest level of restrictions and rules have been tightened up to make them stricter than before. All of the Tier Two rules apply as well as the following: Indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, theatres and bowling alleys must close;

Pubs, restaurants and cafes must close except for takeaway;

Shops and hairdressers and salons will be allowed to remain open;

Groups of six will be allowed to meet outdoors only;

Crowds at live events will be banned;

People should avoid travelling out of, or into, Tier Three areas unless it is unavoidable. Advertisement

Politicians and local leaders are today gathering to mount substantial challenges to the restrictions.

In the capital, Tory heavyweight Sir Iain has told the Telegraph that it 'must' be placed in Tier One to revive the country.

'London is dominant in the economy and we need it to get back to work immediately,' he said.

Another London MP told the Guardian they were 'fiercely lobbying' for pubs, bars and restaurants to be re-opened in the capital.

Sadiq Khan told LBC yesterday: 'It's a bit early to say yet, but based on the numbers that I've seen, which is a slowdown in the virus spreading, it's coming down in parts of London in a couple of boroughs.'

'What I hope would happen is... London would probably be in what is called Tier Two.'

None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures from the seven-day spell ending November 15, the latest date for which data is available.

But in 20 of the 32 boroughs the infection rate rose last week, with the biggest jumps in Havering, Enfield and Redbridge.

The highest infection rate is in Havering, in the north-east of the city, the only borough where they surged above 300 per 100,000.

The number of patients being rushed to hospital in the capital suffering from Covid-19 remains low, according to the Department of Health, at a seven-day average of 154.7 admissions on November 17. But this is far below the peak of the first wave, when on average 748 patients were being taken to hospital with Covid-19 every day.

These levels are also among the lowest in the country, which ministers are expected to argue mean that London can be spared the sharpest curbs on public freedoms.

Mayors in the North of England are also mounting opposition to yet again being placed under higher tiers, with Sheffield city leader Dan Jarvis warning: 'We're willing to do our bit, but we must not be taken for granted.'

Daily hospitalisation rates with Covid-19 across England Region North East&Yorks Midland North West London South East South West East of England Daily admissions 360.7 354.7 239.4 154.7 150.3 110.4 97.9 % change -8.2% -5.5% -14.8% +12.3% +9.5% -8.3% +6.1% This data is based on the latest figures from the Department of Health. Daily admissions is the seven-day average of admissions to November 17. And % change is based on the difference between the average on November 17 and November 10. Advertisement

He added: 'Tougher restrictions have had a massive impact on South Yorkshire's economy.

'The Government said it will return to its levelling up agenda after the pandemic, but the brutal reality is we cannot wait that long.

'At Wednesday's Spending Review, the Government has a golden opportunity to deliver on its promises.

'I've pressed Ministers to bring forward major investment, to give the North the best chance of weathering the storm, ensure businesses survive a tough winter and allow us to kick start the job of economic recovery and renewal.'

Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham has come out hard against being plunged into the toughest measures.

Mr Burnham said a toughened Tier Three 'could be devastating for the hospitality industry and will hit cities and the city economy very, very hard indeed'.

Across England Swale, in Kent, has the worst infection rate in the country at 631.7 per 100,000.

Local leaders there have spoken of their 'frustration' that residents appear not to be following restrictions, and taking simple precautions such as wearing a face mask.

Swale's council leader, Roger Truelove, said lockdown rules in the borough were being 'willfully disregarded', with residents regularly not wearing face coverings and ignoring social distancing.

An emergency council meeting was held yesterday to discuss why the district - which is home to about 150,000 and includes the Isle of Sheppey - has seen such rapid growth of the virus.

THERE WAS ENOUGH INFORMATION ON COVID-19 TO ACT IN JANUARY, SAYS SCIENTIST Enough was known about coronavirus in January to act straight away, but the response was delayed, a leading scientist has said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said that while information about the virus was 'uncertain', action could have been taken. At the start of January the World Health Organisation was aware of a cluster of pneumonia cases - with no deaths - in Wuhan, China, and shared detailed information with member states. Speaking at the Imperial College London's Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics's (J-IDEA) symposium on a post-Covid world, Sir Jeremy said the response to the information was delayed. He said: 'The information you have early may be uncertain, but it's enough to act on. 'I would say that at the end of January we knew enough to have acted. And we waited. 'We waited out of uncertainty, we wanted to be more certain than we needed to be. 'But by the end of January, we knew that this was able to transmit asymptomatically, that it caused a nasty clinical syndrome and a significant number of people were dying, that healthcare workers were getting sick and distant family members were getting sick when people moved from Wuhan to Sichuan, that this was going out of China into other parts of south-east Asia, that we had no diagnostics, no treatment and no vaccines. 'To me, at the time - and this is not in retrospect - I think that was enough to have acted then in ways that we delayed.' Advertisement

The latest analysis of PHE figures, by the Press Association news agency, found Covid-19 case rates started to fall in most local areas across England in the most recent week, up to November 15.

Only two of nine regions - London and the South East - are still recording week-on-week rises in cases. The full impact of England's second national lockdown, however, is yet to become apparent in the data.

It takes up to two weeks for someone who has caught the virus to show symptoms, get tested, and receive a positive result. This means that many infections currently being reported may have occurred before the emergency measures were brought in.

But the latest figures suggest the numbers are heading in the right direction, though not in all parts of England.

The nationwide restrictions began on November 5, and the most recent figures are for the week ending November 15 – just 14 days into the lockdown.

Infection surges were recorded in 34 out of 67 local authorities in the South East, with Medway seeing the biggest jump.

Medway, in Kent, had the sixth biggest surge in infections in the country when they rose by 39.3 per cent to 299 per 100,000.

But the biggest week-on-week falls were recorded in the North West - signalling that earlier measures were helping to drive down cases alongside the lockdown.

Warrington saw the biggest fall in England, where infections dropped by 32.5 per cent to 259.6 per 100,000.

It was followed by Oldham, in Greater Manchester, where infections fell by 30.7 per cent to 519.2 per 100,000.

And Wigan saw the third biggest fall with a 30.3 per cent drop to 403.2 per 100,000.

When the tiered system returns on December 3, they will be reviewed every two weeks to establish whether local authorities need to have stricter curbs imposed or can be dropped to lower restrictions.

It is set to be in place until March 31, at which point the tiered system will come to an end.

Boris Johnson said last night that he hoped the country would be able to get back to normal 'by Easter', predicting this could be when the elderly and most vulnerable members of the population will have received a Covid-19 vaccine.

Three vaccines - including Oxford's jab - have said they are at least 70 per cent effective at triggering an immune response, prompting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to say 'the end of the tunnel' of the pandemic is in sight.

GRANT SHAPPS URGES BRITONS NOT TO USE TRAINS AT CHRISTMAS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE TOO BUSY Grant Shapps today urged Britons not to use trains at Christmas because they will be 'too busy' - as UK ministers meet to thrash out a plan to ease coronavirus rules so family reunions can happen. An announcement is imminent on proposals for a loosening over the festive season, with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove due to chair a Cobra meeting with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But the Transport Secretary has warned that the rail network's 'limitations', with major engineering work and capacity constraints, mean people should avoid using it where possible. In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Shapps said: 'We are going to be appealing to people to look very carefully at the transport route they take and of course even making a choice about whether they travel at all.' News on how restrictions on socialising will be relaxed for a few days - probably from December 23-27 - had been expected today, but might now come later in the week, as sources say 'details need ironing out'. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there could be a 'slight and careful' easing of the rules for a few days while Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething has suggested tough measures to control the virus before Christmas could allow 'more headroom for the festive season'. Mr Gove is set to chair a meeting with the devolved administrations later, in a bid to get the package over the line. Advertisement

The UK has ordered 100million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, with up to four million set to arrive this year. It is also expecting the first part of a delivery of 40million doses from Pfizer and BioNtech - who say their vaccine is 90 per cent effective - by the end of the year, and five million doses from Moderna - with a 94.5 per cent effective shot - in the spring next year.

Leaked NHS plans reveal they could start vaccinating the elderly and most vulnerable against the virus in early December, with vaccines being rolled out to the rest of the population in the new year.

But scientists have urged caution, warning none of the jabs have yet been approved for use by the UK's regulator the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The regulator reviews data on vaccine effectiveness and how safe it is before deciding whether or not to allow it to be administered across the country. It is a process that usually takes two years but, amid pressure to get life back to normal, the regulator has said it is working hard to make a decision quickly.

The Prime Minister detailed his winter strategy yesterday, with a plan to deploy a major testing scheme in an attempt to win over rebels on the Conservative backbenches.

He told tell MPs that non-essential shops can open in all three tiers after the current restrictions expire on December 2, in a boost for retailers.

Mr Johnson also set out the basis of plans to allow a small number of households across the UK to mix over a limited number of days around Christmas.

Vaccines and tiers – all your questions answered

When are we coming out of national lockdown?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the national lockdown imposed on November 5 will come to an end on December 2.

However, England will then move back into a regional tiered system of restrictions – similar to those introduced earlier this year.

What is the tier system?

There are three different tiers of restrictions, which will be imposed at a regional level depending on the number of coronavirus cases in that area.

Those living under Tier 1 restrictions will have the greatest freedoms, while people in Tiers 2 and 3 will face stricter measures.

Official testing data shows that coronavirus infection rates are falling across the North of England, where they were highest during the peak of the second wave, but they remain high in some areas of the West Midlands, Kent, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire (Darker colours indicate higher rates of positive tests per 100,000 people)

LONDON LOCKDOWN REVOLT: MPS WARN PUTTING CAPITAL IN T3 WOULD BE A 'DISASTER' In 20 of London's 32 regions last week there were increases in infection rates. The biggest jumps being Havering (up from 309.4 to 386.0), Enfield (up from 175.6 to 230.4) and Redbridge (up from 249.0 to 300.4) Boris Johnson has been warned by furious London Tories that it would be an economic 'disaster' if the capital was hit with the toughest possible coronavirus restrictions after lockdown ends. City MPs and the Conservative candidate for mayor, Shaun Bailey, sent the Prime Minister a clear warning after it emerged officials could place the metropolis into the top Tier 3 after December 2. They warned such a move could cripple London's entertainment and hospitality industries, with pubs and restaurants open for takeaway and delivery sales only and theatres and other venues remaining closed. None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures. But speaking to business leaders via Zoom last night, Mr Bailey said: 'I absolutely agree it would be a disaster for London if we were in Tier 3. Advertisement

How will they decide on what tier to introduce?

Regions with high numbers of cases will face tighter measures, while those with fewer cases will have their restrictions relaxed.

To decide which tier to apply to a specific area, officials will look at coronavirus cases across all age groups, and specifically among the over-60s who are considered most at risk.

They will also consider whether infection rates are rising or falling and the prevalence of the disease per 100,000 of the population.

When will I find out what tier I'm in?

An announcement will be made on Thursday.

What is allowed under each tier?

Under Tier 1, people can meet a maximum of six friends or family outdoors or indoors.

Pubs and restaurants can reopen, but with table service only and an 11pm closing time.

In Tier 2, people from two different households cannot mix indoors, and outdoor gatherings will be limited to six.

Pubs will remain closed unless operating as restaurants, with alcohol only served as part of a 'substantial meal'.

Retail and personal care – such as hairdressers and beauty salons – can reopen in all tiers, and indoor entertainment venues – such as cinemas, theatres, bowling alleys and casinos – will be allowed to stay open in Tiers 1 and 2, but not Tier 3.

Tier 3 areas will see the hospitality sector remain closed except for takeaways, and groups of six will only be able to meet in outdoor public spaces.

Can I travel between tiers?

People in Tier 3 areas should avoid travelling to other parts of the UK, including for overnight stays unless it is for work, education, health or care requirements.

Likewise, those in Tier 1 and 2 areas should not travel to Tier 3 zones, but can pass through them as part of a longer journey.

Should I start making plans for Christmas?

Not just yet. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was unable to confirm on Monday any details as to how people would be able to spend the festive period.

However, a plan to allow families to be reunited for Christmas is being developed with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

HANCOCK CLAIMS T3 WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH BEFORE LOCKDOWN Matt Hancock has claimed Tier Three restrictions imposed before lockdown were not tough enough to halt the spread of Covid-19, and revealed he hopes damaging restrictions on Britons lives will be lifted after Easter. Speaking to Parliament's Health and Social Care Committee, the 'architect' of the tiered system said he was convinced a second lockdown was needed when cases suddenly surged in all areas of England. The then-spiralling numbers, he said, meant that 'even in the lower prevalence areas you could see they were going to get to high prevalence if we didn't act'. Public Health England data reveals the sharpest spike in infections across England was in the week ending October 4, when almost every local authority saw Covid-19 infections surge by more than 50 per cent. Ministers then rushed out the tiered system - which came into force on October 14 - in an attempt to suppress escalating cases. But just 23 days later - and amid growing evidence that Tier Three was driving down infections - they hit the nuclear button and imposed a second nationwide lockdown. The Health Secretary and Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove are thought to have been the main supporters of the stringent measures in the cabinet. Mr Hancock appeared today in front of the committee to answer questions on the Government's handling of the pandemic, including whether Test and Trace is working, whether the first lockdown was imposed early enough and why a circuit breaker was avoided. Boris Johnson yesterday unveiled his beefed-up tier system, with Tier Three now forcing all restaurants and bars to shift to take-away only. Advertisement

Is there a vaccine yet?

Not quite. Although vaccine developers have started to publish the interim results from their trials, which have so far been positive.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca team announced its vaccine had proved up to 90% effective.

When will it be ready?

No one can be certain at this stage as no vaccine has been approved for use yet.

But the jab is likely to be rolled out in the UK from December, with the bulk of vaccination in the new year.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, if all goes well in the next couple of weeks, the vaccination programme could potentially be rolled out from next month for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.

Will I have to pay for a jab?

No, the vaccine will be free on the NHS.

Will there be enough for everyone?

The Government said it has secured access to more than 350 million doses of vaccine from seven developers between now and the end of 2021, which is enough to potentially vaccinate the whole population.

Do I have to get a vaccine?

There are no plans to make vaccination compulsory, Downing Street said earlier in November.

However, Mr Hancock has also refused to rule out making it mandatory.

How long will immunity last?

The Government said in its Covid Winter Plan that the exact strength and duration of immunity provided through vaccination is not yet known.

Protection through vaccination takes time to build and requires a full course, but it is still unknown how well the first vaccines will stop the virus from passing between people.

Can I choose what vaccine I get?

As things stand, the vaccines will be rolled out as and when they become available, depending on which are approved first and how quickly companies can make them.

No announcement has been made on whether one might be given priority over another as they become ready on a mass scale.

People are not expected to be able to choose which jab they want to receive.

When will life return to normal?

While it is not known exactly how long it might take for the population to be vaccinated, Mr Hancock has said it is looking as though things may start returning to normal after Easter.

But until then, and until there is some kind of herd immunity in the population, achieved through vaccination, people will need to continue to wear face masks, socially distance and wash their hands.";"(2019-12-13)

# The first COVID-19 vaccines won’t end the U.S. crisis right away

Don’t even think of putting your mask away anytime soon.

Despite the expected arrival of the first COVID-19 vaccines in just a few weeks, it could take several months — probably well into 2021 — before things get back to something close to normal in the U.S. and Americans can once again go to the movies, cheer at an NBA game or give Grandma a hug.

The first, limited shipments of the vaccine would mark just the beginning of what could be a long and messy road toward the end of the pandemic that has upended life and killed more than a quarter-million people in the U.S. In the meantime, Americans are being warned not to let their guard down.

“If you’re fighting a battle and the cavalry is on the way, you don’t stop shooting; you keep going until the cavalry gets here, and then you might even want to continue fighting,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said last week.

This week, AstraZeneca became the third vaccine maker to say early data indicates its shots are highly effective. Pfizer last week asked the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization to begin distributing its vaccine, and Moderna is expected to do the same any day. Federal officials say the first doses will ship within a day of authorization.

But most people will probably have to wait months for shots to become widely available. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines also both require two doses, meaning people will have to go back for a second shot after three and four weeks, respectively, to get the full protection.

Moncef Slaoui, head of the U.S. vaccine development effort, said on CNN on Sunday that early data on the Pfizer and Moderna shots suggest about 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity — a milestone he said is likely to be reached in May.

But along the way, experts say the logistical challenges of the biggest vaccination campaign in U.S. history and public fear and misinformation could hinder the effort and kick the end of the pandemic further down the road.

“It’s going to be a slow process and it’s going to be a process with ups and downs, like we’ve seen already,” said Dr. Bill Moss, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University.

Once federal officials give a vaccine the go-ahead, doses that are already being stockpiled will be deployed with the goal of “putting needles in people’s arms” within 24 to 48 hours, said Paul Mango, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official involved in the Operation Warp Speed effort to develop COVID-19 vaccines.

Those first shipments are expected to be limited and will be directed to high-risk groups at designated locations, such as frontline healthcare workers at hospitals.

Federal and state officials are still figuring out exactly how to prioritize those most at risk, including the elderly, prison inmates and homeless people. By the end of January, HHS officials say, all senior citizens should be able to get shots, assuming a vaccine becomes available by the end of 2020.

For everyone else, they expect widespread availability of vaccines would start a couple of months later.

To make shots easily accessible, state and federal officials are enlisting a vast network of providers, such as pharmacies and doctor’s offices.

But some worry long lines won’t be the problem.

“One of the things that may be a factor that hasn’t been discussed that much is: How many will be willing to be vaccinated?” said Christine Finley, director of Vermont’s immunization program. She noted that the accelerated development of the vaccine and the politics around it have fueled worries about safety.

Even if the first vaccines prove as effective as suggested by early data, they won’t have much impact if enough people don’t get them.

Vaccines aren’t always effective in everyone: Over the past decade, for example, seasonal flu vaccines have been effective in from 20% to 60% of people who get them.

AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna say early trial data suggests their vaccine candidates are about 90% or more effective. But those rates could change by the time the studies end.

Also, the definition of “effective” can vary.

Rather than prevent infection entirely, the first COVID-19 vaccines might only prevent illness. Vaccinated people might still be able to contract and transmit the virus, another reason experts say masks will remain crucial for some time.

Another important aspect of vaccines: They can take awhile to work.

The first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine might bring about a degree of protection within a couple of weeks, meaning people who get infected might not get as sick as they otherwise would. But full protection could take up to two weeks after the second shot — or about six weeks after the first shot, said Deborah Fuller, a vaccine expert at the University of Washington.

People who don’t understand that lag could mistakenly think the vaccine made them sick if they happen to come down with COVID-19 soon after a shot. People might also blame the vaccine for unrelated health problems and amplify those fears online.

“All you need is a few people getting on social media,” Moss said.

Advertisement

There’s also the possibility of real side effects. COVID-19 vaccine trials have to include at least 30,000 people, but the chances of a rare side effect turning up are more likely as growing numbers of people are vaccinated.

Even if a link between the vaccine and a possible side effect seems likely, distribution of the shots might not be halted if the risk is deemed small and is outweighed by the benefits, said Dr. Wilbur Chen, a vaccine expert at the University of Maryland.

But Chen said public health officials will need to clearly explain the relative risks to avoid public panic.

Depending on whether the virus mutates in coming years and how long the vaccine’s protection lasts, booster shots later on may also be necessary, said Dr. Edward Belongia, a vaccine researcher with the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Wisconsin.

Belongia and many others say the coronavirus won’t ever be stamped out and will become one of the many seasonal viruses that sicken people. How quickly will vaccines help reduce the threat of the virus to that level?

# Anxiety Associated With Faster Alzheimer’s Disease Onset

Summary: Anxiety may accelerate the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. Brain scans revealed patients who progressed from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease had decreased volume in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

Source: RSNA

Anxiety is associated with an increased rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study being presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Alzheimer’s disease represents a major public health crisis worldwide. The number of deaths from the disease has more than doubled since 2000, and it is currently the fifth-leading cause of death among individuals over 65 in the U.S.

Many people with Alzheimer’s disease first suffer from mild cognitive impairment, a decline in cognitive abilities like memory and thinking skills that is more rapid than normally associated with aging. Anxiety has been frequently observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment, although its role in disease progression is not well understood.

“We know that volume loss in certain areas of the brain is a factor that predicts progression to Alzheimer’s disease,” said study senior author Maria Vittoria Spampinato, M.D., professor of radiology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston. “In this study, we wanted to see if anxiety had an effect on brain structure, or if the effect of anxiety was independent from brain structure in favoring the progression of disease.”

The study group included 339 patients, average age of 72 years, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 cohort. Each person had a baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment; 72 progressed to Alzheimer’s disease while 267 remained stable.

The researchers obtained brain MRIs to determine the baseline volumes of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, two areas important to forming memories. They also tested for the presence of the ApoE4 allele, the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Anxiety was measured with established clinical surveys.

As expected, patients who progressed to Alzheimer’s disease had significantly lower volumes in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex and greater frequency of the ApoE4 allele. Most notably though, the researchers found that anxiety was independently associated with cognitive decline.

“Mild cognitive impairment patients with anxiety symptoms developed Alzheimer’s disease faster than individuals without anxiety, independently of whether they had a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease or brain volume loss,” said study first author Jenny L. Ulber, a medical student at MUSC.

The link between anxiety symptoms and a faster progression to Alzheimer’s disease presents an opportunity for improving the screening and management of patients with early mild cognitive impairment, the researchers said.

“We need to better understand the association between anxiety disorders and cognitive decline,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We don’t know yet if the anxiety is a symptom–in other words, their memory is getting worse and they become anxious–or if anxiety contributes to cognitive decline. If we were able in the future to find that anxiety is actually causing progression, then we should more aggressively screen for anxiety disorders in the elderly.”

Brain MRI of a 72-year-old woman shows loss of volume of the hippocampus (arrows). The patient had all three characteristics, volume loss of the hippocampi, APOE4, and anxiety, found in the study to be associated with progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Credit: RSNA

“The geriatric population is routinely screened for depression in many hospitals, but perhaps this vulnerable population should also be assessed for anxiety disorders,” Ulber added. “Middle-aged and elderly individuals with high level of anxiety may benefit from intervention, whether it be pharmacological or cognitive behavioral therapy, with the goal of slowing cognitive decline.”

The study was based on MRI scans done at one point in time. For future research, the team would like to study MRIs obtained after the initial scan to better understand the connection between anxiety and brain structure.

“We’re now interested in looking at changes over time to see if anxiety has an effect one way or the other on how fast the brain damage progresses,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We will also take a closer look at gender differences in the association between anxiety and cognitive decline.”

# Coronavirus England: Deaths rise 28% in one week to 2,466

Advertisement

Covid deaths in England continued to rise in mid-November to 2,274 in the second week of the month, meaning deaths from all causes were 19 per cent higher than usual for the time of year.

Office for National Statistics data published today shows there were 1,833 excess deaths in the week that ended November 13, with a total of 11,495 people dying.

Although higher than average, the figure is only just over half the 21,157 deaths from all causes in England's worst week in April during the peak of the first wave — when Covid claimed around 8,000 lives.

The number of people dying with the viral infection is now on par with those succumbing to flu or pneumonia for the first time since June.

The coronavirus deaths recorded in the week that ended November 13 were a rise of 503 on the 1,771 recorded in the first week of the month. The data won't take into account any effects of lockdown because it can take infected patients several weeks to fall severely ill.

Figures show that numbers of people dying of any cause is higher than average in all regions, with the northern parts of England still worst hit by Covid. In the North West, deaths are 38 per cent higher than usual, while in the South East they are only marginally higher at two per cent.

Hospitals, care homes and private homes are all seeing more fatalities than they would expect to at this time of year, and one in five deaths are now linked to Covid-19, compared to one in six a week earlier. But the ONS data is backdated and known to be too old to reflect the current situation in the country.

Department of Health death counts, which take in daily totals from hospitals and care homes for the whole UK, suggest that the number of people being killed by Covid-19 has started to level off after a surge in October.

In the last three weeks of October, from the 10th to the 31st, the average number of people dying with coronavirus each day soared four-fold from 63 to 259, while in the first three weeks of November it rose far more slowly – by 57 per cent from 260 to 409.

There are signs of a flattening in the trend, although experts have warned deaths will likely stay in the hundreds per day for weeks to come as the effects of huge numbers of infections in October and early November continue to trickle through.

The deaths recorded in this week's ONS release all happened between November 7 and November 13.

Because it generally takes between two and three weeks for Covid victims to die after they have caught the virus, this means that most of the coronavirus deaths in the updated numbers were people who got infected in the last week of October.

This means the number of people dying was still increasing in this week as a result of the fast-growing numbers of infections the country saw as the second wave spiralled out of control.

The ONS itself estimated that more than 50,000 people were catching the virus every day by the end of last month, with a Government-funded study suggesting the figure could have been as high as 100,000 a day.

Although lockdown appears to have brought this under control – estimates suggest the R rate has fallen noticeably and that daily infections were down to around 39,000 after the first week of lockdown – it will take weeks for this to filter through into the death counts.

Daily case counts were first to fall when the effects of lockdown started to sink in – the average number of new positive tests has fallen from a peak of 25,000 a day nine days ago to 19,500 now.

Hospitalisations will follow suit as fewer infections leads to fewer severe cases, and then deaths will drop as the total numbers of people in hospitals falls.

Although the number of people dying is not surging as fast as it did during the UK's first wave of Covid-19, it still marks the deaths of hundreds of people every day.

Dr Sarah Scobie, research director at the Nuffield Trust health think-tank, said today: 'Despite the end of the second national lockdown in England coming into focus, today’s figures are a sobering reminder of the dreadful impact of this virus.

'For the first time since the end of the first wave, over 2,000 Covid deaths have been registered in a single week.

'We've seen a sharp jump in the number of deaths in hospital in the week ending November 13, with Covid now accounting for a third of patients dying in hospital. Deaths in care homes and private homes are also higher than we'd expect at this time of year.'

Today's ONS update showed that all English regions, and Wales, saw a higher number of registered deaths than the five-year average.

North West England had 615 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in the week ending November 13 – the highest number for the region since the week ending May 15.

LOSS OF TASTE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IN SECOND WAVE A lost sense of taste was the most common symptom among people with coronavirus in England's second wave, Office for National Statistics data suggests. The ONS analysed reports of symptoms among people getting swabbed in its mass testing programme between August and October. Symptoms around the time of the test were considered. It compared how often people with a certain symptom tested positive, and how often people with certain symptoms tested positive for the virus. It found that loss of taste was far more common among positive cases than coughs or fevers, which are seen as the more typical and obvious signs of Covid-19. Between 35 and 45 per cent of people testing positive for coronavirus lost their sense of taste, the ONS found. Its graphs suggested that as many as 45 per cent of people between the ages of 18 and 35 experienced the effect, compared to 30 per cent of older or younger age groups. By comparison, fever was found in around 10-20 per cent of people, and coughing in 10 per cent or fewer. The report said people with symptoms tested positive more often than those without: 'The positivity rates in those with specific symptoms or other evidence of symptoms are higher than those not reporting any evidence of symptoms.' It added in a series of caveats that the symptoms were self-reported and not diagnosed by a doctor, and that they did not include those among people who were in hospitals or care homes.

In Yorkshire and the Humber, 450 Covid-19 deaths were registered in that week, while there were 284 in the West Midlands and 245 in the East Midlands.

Weekly registered deaths not involving Covid-19 were below the five-year average for the third consecutive week, the ONS said.

A total of 68,524 deaths have so far been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, according to the latest reports from the UK’s statistics agencies.

This includes 62,162 deaths in England and Wales up to November 13 which were confirmed by the ONS on Tuesday.

Since these statistics were compiled, a further 2,432 deaths are known to have occurred in England, plus 80 in Scotland, 128 in Wales and 91 in Northern Ireland, according to additional data published on the Government’s coronavirus dashboard.

Together, these totals mean that so far 71,255 deaths involving Covid-19 have taken place in the UK, when figures from the statistical bodies of Scotland and Northern Ireland are also included.

These are deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.

Of all deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales, around two thirds occurred in hospital, (40,062 deaths), the figures show.

The remainder occurred in care homes (16,849 deaths), private homes (2,927 deaths), hospices (833 deaths), other communal establishments (242 deaths) and elsewhere (223 deaths).

More than 30,000 excess deaths not linked to Covid-19 have occurred in private homes since the start of the pandemic.

There were 30,785 non-Covid excess deaths in homes in England and Wales registered between March 7 and November 13, the ONS said.

In a separate report published this morning the ONS revealed that a lost sense of taste was the most common symptom among people with coronavirus in England's second wave.

The ONS analysed reports of symptoms among people getting swabbed in its mass testing programme between August and October.

It compared how often people with a certain symptom tested positive, and how often people with certain symptoms tested positive for the virus.

It found that loss of taste was far more common among positive cases than coughs or fevers, which are seen as the more typical and obvious signs of Covid-19.

Between 35 and 45 per cent of people testing positive for coronavirus lost their sense of taste, the ONS found.

By comparison, fever was found in around 10-20 per cent of people, and coughing in 10 per cent or fewer.

The report said people with symptoms tested positive more often than those without: 'The positivity rates in those with specific symptoms or other evidence of symptoms are higher than those not reporting any evidence of symptoms.'";"(2020-05-21)

# COVID Vaccine Might Spur Some Sickness

By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter

TUESDAY, Nov. 24, 2020 – At least three new COVID-19 vaccine candidates are already in the pipeline, will a roll-out expected early in the new year. But on Monday, experts attending a meeting of an advisory committee to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stressed that Americans who get a shot shouldn't be surprised if they feel under the weather for a few days afterwards.

""These are immune responses, so if you feel something after vaccination, you should expect to feel that. And when you do, it's normal that you have some arm soreness or some fatigue or some body aches or even some fever,"" Patricia Stinchfield of Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, told the meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. She represents the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, and said providers must be ready to explain this to people who line up to get any COVID-19 vaccine.

Vaccines work to fight disease by producing an immune response within the body. And sometimes that means flu-like symptoms, such as aches, headache and fever.

Already, some volunteers in trials of candidate vaccines from drug companies Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca have reported flu-like symptoms after immunization. And experts worry that those reports might keep people away from vaccination, or from required second doses.

The CDC's Dr. Sara Oliver told the committee during the five-hour-long meeting that, depending on the survey, anywhere between 40% and 80% of Americans say they'd be willing to get vaccinated.

Dr. Paul Hunter, of the city of Milwaukee health department and a voting member of the committee, said the testimonials of the first batches of people who get a COVID-19 vaccine could be crucial to wider acceptance.

""The people who highly value getting the vaccine soon and fast, early, are going to be really helpful to everyone else. And I think we really are going to need to honor them, because they are going to let us know how it feels,"" he told the committee. ""And I think these people are likely to be health care workers who are likely to be up for that kind of task.""

Another vaccine candidate

Americans were greeted with a possible advance against coronavirus as Thanksgiving week began: A third vaccine candidate shows good results in shielding recipients against the virus.

Meanwhile, U.S. coronavirus cases continued to explode: More than 179,000 new cases were recorded on Monday, with more than 12.4 million Americans now known to be infected.

Hopes for the roll-out of another effective vaccine brightened on Monday, however. Drug giant AstraZeneca announcing that late-stage clinical trials of its coronavirus shot showed it to be 70.4% effective, The New York Times reported.

The trials were conducted in the United Kingdom and Brazil in collaboration with the University of Oxford. The AstraZeneca vaccine becomes the third shot to show good effectiveness, following on the heels of promising data on vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. Both of the latter two shots had effectiveness around 95%.

The AstraZeneca results were based on the results of two dosing regimens for the vaccine: One regimen showed an effectiveness of 62%, the company said, while the other showed a 90% effectiveness.

The regimen showing a 90% effectiveness involved a first dose given at half strength and a second dose given at standard strength. No severe cases of COVID-19 emerged among any recipients, and there was a reduction in asymptomatic infections, suggesting that the vaccine was reducing transmission of the virus, AstraZeneca said.

Worsening spread

In the meantime, the new coronavirus is spreading across America with unprecedented speed, the White House Coronavirus Task Force said in its first briefing in four months on Thursday.

""This is more cases, more rapidly, than what we had seen before,"" Dr. Deborah Birx said during the briefing. ""You can see the increase in test positivity to around 10%."" That's the number of people tested who get a positive diagnosis.

# Tennessee, Texas Among Guinea Pigs for New COVID Vaccine

Have you been surprised or scared by the rapid rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine? If so, you’re not alone. The promise of a COVID-19 vaccine is materializing at a breakneck speed. As Pfizer prepares for the release of their new COVID-19 vaccine, 4 states have been selected as mass testing sites for the unproven inoculation. Chief among them is my home state of Tennessee, where Governor Bill Lee has held meetings with vaccine czar Bill Gates. In an industry already protected from legal repercussions and exempt from standard safety testing, this new vaccine ushers in a new era of danger.
With one of the shortest testing periods on record and a middling amount of data that would be laughed out of any other study, the vaccine is set to be released in four states: Tennessee, Texas, Rhode Island, and New Mexico. This vaccine will be dangerous, government leaders are being pressured and influenced by outside parties, and the nation is already preparing to make this vaccine mandatory. 
Pfizer’s COVID Vaccine is Untested and Dangerous
First, it’s important to understand that vaccine developers play by a different set of rules than the rest of the pharmaceutical industry. Most pharmaceutical trials require months – if not years – of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. But because the industries making a profit insist that vaccines are essential to the health of children, they’ve been shielded from ever conducting studies in a manner that the scientific community demands in any other circumstance. 
Meanwhile, the “standards” for vaccine safety are set by previously released, untested vaccines. So new vaccines are tested against existing vaccines to see if they’re more dangerous. It’s like letting your children play with a wild bear because it’s not as dangerous as a tiger. The logic is absurd. 
In fact, the testing periods are so short that many adverse effects couldn’t possibly be documented in time to be reflected in the study results. Take the hot-button issue of autism. Vaccine manufacturers swear that vaccines don’t cause autism, but autism spectrum disorders often take years to develop. Of course a safety testing period of only a few days won’t reflect the long-term damage these injections can cause. 
When it comes to COVID-19 vaccines, companies completely skipped animal testing and went straight to human trials – something UNHEARD OF in modern medicine. But that issue is even worse now that companies are emboldened by the COVID-19 “crisis.” 
In the UK, emergency requests for new AI were submitted to handle what is expected to be an “overwhelming” number of reported adverse effects from the vaccine. Nations are actively preparing for this vaccine to cause harm, and yet the Big Pharma train keeps on rolling. 
Pfizer boasts that their new vaccine is 95% effective at stopping the virus… but there are a lot of problems with that number. First, the amount of safety data available barely registers on a statistical level. Pfizer is asking the corrupt FDA for an “emergency authorization” to start administering the vaccine within days. 
Second, the study completely ignored people who have already been sick or tested positive for the virus. This means that they have absolutely NO CLUE what would happen if they administered the vaccine to someone who has already contracted the virus. And with hundreds of thousands of people untested, it would be nearly impossible to administer the vaccine on a global scale without injecting people who had already had the virus, whether they were asymptomatic or simply never went to a doctor.
Third, this is just ONE study that has yet to be peer reviewed or duplicated. Normally, a study must be peer-reviewed before being published. Oftentimes, these studies are sent back for more complete research before being accepted by a medical publication. Additionally, virtually no one has had a chance to replicate the study. There are simply too many variables and not nearly enough data for any sane person to declare that this vaccine is safe or effective. 
However, Pfizer is planning to roll it out all the same, and their stock value has gone up while the shares of rival vaccine manufacturer Moderna took a nosedive. And money is just one of the reasons that this vaccine is being rushed past any kind of reasonable safety protocols. The other is power. 
Which brings us to Bill Gates…
Is Money Influencing Government Leaders?
Here at TTAC, we’ve discussed Bill Gates in depth  (here, here, and here, for example), but what we haven’t yet covered is his cozy relationship with our state of Tennessee. Ever the generous philanthropist, Gates has spent an inordinate amount of time and resources “investing” in Tennessee… especially the school system. Earlier this year, Gates visited local schools to talk about his plan to improve the state’s education. Not to mention the many visits between Bill Gates and Tennessee’s governor, Bill Lee.
Now, the state is scheduled to be one of the first locations for mass administration of this completely untested vaccine. According to Reuters, Pfizer chose Tennessee because of its “immunization infrastructure,” which Governor Lee confirmed in a tweet this week.  
“Pfizer selected our state because of our ability to build out a strong infrastructure and we are thankful for their partnership,” he gushed. 
It may not be a coincidence that Pfizer chose Tennessee for the early pilot program. Competing manufacturer Moderna has developed a vaccine in partnership with researchers at Vanderbilt, Emory University, the National Institutes of Health, and others. Vanderbilt’s research is funded in part by Tennessee’s own Dolly Parton, who donated $1 million to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s COVID-19 research fund.
Moderna’s vaccine is expected to be available 7 to 10 days AFTER Pfizer’s product hits the market. [But we’re supposed to believe that everyone is “in this together” to find a cure for COVID, right?]
During a recent news conference, Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey said that Tennessee will be ready to distribute vaccines on Dec. 1, although it’s not yet clear when vaccine doses will be approved and distributed to other states.
Once the FDA receives information from vaccine developers, it could take several days to a few weeks for the vaccines to be approved, Piercey said. After approval, vaccines may begin to be distributed in as little as 24 hours. Tennessee does not plan to require additional approval of vaccines at the state level once the FDA has approved vaccines for distribution to states, she added. 
That’s right. 
Tennessee plans to green light an extremely experimental drug with absolutely no further testing or approval processes. 
Is it possible that governor Bill Lee cut a deal with Pfizer or Gates to help them be first to market their new shot? We know that Gates spent a considerable amount of time (and money) in Tennessee over the past few months. And Lee has been more than willing to exercise dictatorial authority in response to the virus. 
We reached out to his office to ask about financial ties or other funding provided by Pfizer or Gates, but were told by his office that he was unavailable for comment. 
Tennessee unveiled its initial vaccine distribution plan on Oct. 21, establishing a draft hierarchy for who gets the vaccine during three phases of availability. At the time, state officials said they did not yet know which vaccines the state will receive, how many doses are coming or when those doses will arrive for distribution.
“This initially will not be widely available,” Piercey said Tuesday, adding that widespread availability is not anticipated until spring of 2021.
The plan states that 85% of Tennessee’s vaccines will be distributed across its 95 counties based on population, 5% of Tennessee’s doses will be distributed equitably across the 95 counties regardless of population and disease burden, and 10% will be retained by the state for potential unanticipated priority needs.
The plan’s first phrase prioritizes the first doses for first responders and front line health care workers. Tennesseans with illnesses that put them at high risk of virus complications, older individuals with high-risk illnesses and those in congregate care facilities will also receive priority.
In a second phase, Tennessee will prioritize vaccination for staff in schools and childcare businesses, as well as older adults with “medium-risk” illnesses and workers in “critical infrastructure” industries. The third and final phase would include children, young adults, others in congregate care settings, and, eventually, everyone else. And that plan extends beyond Tennessee.
It’s worth mentioning, however, that there are still some government leaders resisting the push for mandatory vaccinations. In Texas, Governor Greg Abbott made it abundantly clear that this vaccine will be optional for all citizens.
The Nation is Preparing for Mandatory Vaccinations
The mass COVID hysteria is all leading up to one thing: forced vaccinations. Our schools and businesses have been closed, hunger and depression have skyrocketed, and some government agencies are already planning to withhold food stamps and other social safety nets for anyone who doesn’t get in line for a shot. 
In New York City, public schools were just closed again, with no clear plan for reopening. What are the odds that children won’t be allowed back in school without the new COVID vaccine coursing through their bodies? 
The odds are pretty good, especially in New York. Just last year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency due to the increased incidence of measles in Brooklyn. The reported cases of measles have been primarily limited to the Orthodox Jewish community in Williamsburg, a neighborhood in Brooklyn. According to Reuters, anyone who has not received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine will face a fine up to $1,000.
“It was time to take a more muscular approach. The faster everyone heeds the order, the faster we can lift it,” said de Blasio. But lifting a mandate only once everyone has complied hardly equates to freedom. And this is hardly an isolated incident. 
Just this afternoon, Pretender-Elect Joe Biden held a press conference in which he stressed the importance of getting a COVID-19 vaccine ready. “We need to get this into all 330 million Americans,” he said. 
And he may have military backing.

Check out this clip (shared by our good friend Erin Elizabeth) where General Gustave Perna explains Operation Warp Speed:

https://cdn.thetruthaboutcancer.com/wp-content/uploads/20201124173221/Military-Vax.mp4
In the partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense, General Perna makes it clear that all of America MUST receive the vaccine within 24 hours.

WHAT?!?
Ever since this virus appeared, governments and corporations have been making a run for it with our freedoms and our money. Remember that stimulus check a few months back? Hundreds of billions of dollars went to big corporations. Your tax dollars. Meanwhile, we can’t go to a grocery store or walk through an airport without being accosted about wearing a mask.
We expected the government to negotiate with bargaining chips that aren’t theirs to begin with. They’ve been trying to hold public education hostage for years. Now they’ve got small businesses between a rock and a hard place. Thousands of children are starving to death every month because of the lockdowns imposed without proper approval by state and local legislatures. Domestic violence, drug abuse, and suicide are skyrocketing. 
Maybe you wear a mask because you need to buy groceries for your family. Maybe you open your business at 30% capacity for fear of being shut down. Maybe you’ve missed weddings, funerals, births, and holidays because of these extreme travel restrictions.
But the stakes just got higher. We have generals talking about requiring every American to get vaccinated. We have manufacturers skipping over even the most basic safety protocols. We have Joe Biden on live television telling us that vaccinating every American is our top priority. 
We’ve been told that we must all get this dangerous new shot in order to get our lives back. They want to force me and my children to be injected with an experimental new drug just so we can buy food or go to church?
Over my dead body.";"(2020-03-13)

# Anxiety Associated With Faster Alzheimer’s Disease Onset

Summary: Anxiety may accelerate the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. Brain scans revealed patients who progressed from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease had decreased volume in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

Source: RSNA

Anxiety is associated with an increased rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study being presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Alzheimer’s disease represents a major public health crisis worldwide. The number of deaths from the disease has more than doubled since 2000, and it is currently the fifth-leading cause of death among individuals over 65 in the U.S.

Many people with Alzheimer’s disease first suffer from mild cognitive impairment, a decline in cognitive abilities like memory and thinking skills that is more rapid than normally associated with aging. Anxiety has been frequently observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment, although its role in disease progression is not well understood.

“We know that volume loss in certain areas of the brain is a factor that predicts progression to Alzheimer’s disease,” said study senior author Maria Vittoria Spampinato, M.D., professor of radiology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston. “In this study, we wanted to see if anxiety had an effect on brain structure, or if the effect of anxiety was independent from brain structure in favoring the progression of disease.”

The study group included 339 patients, average age of 72 years, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 cohort. Each person had a baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment; 72 progressed to Alzheimer’s disease while 267 remained stable.

The researchers obtained brain MRIs to determine the baseline volumes of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, two areas important to forming memories. They also tested for the presence of the ApoE4 allele, the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Anxiety was measured with established clinical surveys.

As expected, patients who progressed to Alzheimer’s disease had significantly lower volumes in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex and greater frequency of the ApoE4 allele. Most notably though, the researchers found that anxiety was independently associated with cognitive decline.

“Mild cognitive impairment patients with anxiety symptoms developed Alzheimer’s disease faster than individuals without anxiety, independently of whether they had a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease or brain volume loss,” said study first author Jenny L. Ulber, a medical student at MUSC.

The link between anxiety symptoms and a faster progression to Alzheimer’s disease presents an opportunity for improving the screening and management of patients with early mild cognitive impairment, the researchers said.

“We need to better understand the association between anxiety disorders and cognitive decline,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We don’t know yet if the anxiety is a symptom–in other words, their memory is getting worse and they become anxious–or if anxiety contributes to cognitive decline. If we were able in the future to find that anxiety is actually causing progression, then we should more aggressively screen for anxiety disorders in the elderly.”

Brain MRI of a 72-year-old woman shows loss of volume of the hippocampus (arrows). The patient had all three characteristics, volume loss of the hippocampi, APOE4, and anxiety, found in the study to be associated with progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Credit: RSNA

“The geriatric population is routinely screened for depression in many hospitals, but perhaps this vulnerable population should also be assessed for anxiety disorders,” Ulber added. “Middle-aged and elderly individuals with high level of anxiety may benefit from intervention, whether it be pharmacological or cognitive behavioral therapy, with the goal of slowing cognitive decline.”

The study was based on MRI scans done at one point in time. For future research, the team would like to study MRIs obtained after the initial scan to better understand the connection between anxiety and brain structure.

“We’re now interested in looking at changes over time to see if anxiety has an effect one way or the other on how fast the brain damage progresses,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We will also take a closer look at gender differences in the association between anxiety and cognitive decline.”

# Coronavirus England: Deaths rise 28% in one week to 2,466

Advertisement

Covid deaths in England continued to rise in mid-November to 2,274 in the second week of the month, meaning deaths from all causes were 19 per cent higher than usual for the time of year.

Office for National Statistics data published today shows there were 1,833 excess deaths in the week that ended November 13, with a total of 11,495 people dying.

Although higher than average, the figure is only just over half the 21,157 deaths from all causes in England's worst week in April during the peak of the first wave — when Covid claimed around 8,000 lives.

The number of people dying with the viral infection is now on par with those succumbing to flu or pneumonia for the first time since June.

The coronavirus deaths recorded in the week that ended November 13 were a rise of 503 on the 1,771 recorded in the first week of the month. The data won't take into account any effects of lockdown because it can take infected patients several weeks to fall severely ill.

Figures show that numbers of people dying of any cause is higher than average in all regions, with the northern parts of England still worst hit by Covid. In the North West, deaths are 38 per cent higher than usual, while in the South East they are only marginally higher at two per cent.

Hospitals, care homes and private homes are all seeing more fatalities than they would expect to at this time of year, and one in five deaths are now linked to Covid-19, compared to one in six a week earlier. But the ONS data is backdated and known to be too old to reflect the current situation in the country.

Department of Health death counts, which take in daily totals from hospitals and care homes for the whole UK, suggest that the number of people being killed by Covid-19 has started to level off after a surge in October.

In the last three weeks of October, from the 10th to the 31st, the average number of people dying with coronavirus each day soared four-fold from 63 to 259, while in the first three weeks of November it rose far more slowly – by 57 per cent from 260 to 409.

There are signs of a flattening in the trend, although experts have warned deaths will likely stay in the hundreds per day for weeks to come as the effects of huge numbers of infections in October and early November continue to trickle through.

The deaths recorded in this week's ONS release all happened between November 7 and November 13.

Because it generally takes between two and three weeks for Covid victims to die after they have caught the virus, this means that most of the coronavirus deaths in the updated numbers were people who got infected in the last week of October.

This means the number of people dying was still increasing in this week as a result of the fast-growing numbers of infections the country saw as the second wave spiralled out of control.

The ONS itself estimated that more than 50,000 people were catching the virus every day by the end of last month, with a Government-funded study suggesting the figure could have been as high as 100,000 a day.

Although lockdown appears to have brought this under control – estimates suggest the R rate has fallen noticeably and that daily infections were down to around 39,000 after the first week of lockdown – it will take weeks for this to filter through into the death counts.

Daily case counts were first to fall when the effects of lockdown started to sink in – the average number of new positive tests has fallen from a peak of 25,000 a day nine days ago to 19,500 now.

Hospitalisations will follow suit as fewer infections leads to fewer severe cases, and then deaths will drop as the total numbers of people in hospitals falls.

Although the number of people dying is not surging as fast as it did during the UK's first wave of Covid-19, it still marks the deaths of hundreds of people every day.

Dr Sarah Scobie, research director at the Nuffield Trust health think-tank, said today: 'Despite the end of the second national lockdown in England coming into focus, today’s figures are a sobering reminder of the dreadful impact of this virus.

'For the first time since the end of the first wave, over 2,000 Covid deaths have been registered in a single week.

'We've seen a sharp jump in the number of deaths in hospital in the week ending November 13, with Covid now accounting for a third of patients dying in hospital. Deaths in care homes and private homes are also higher than we'd expect at this time of year.'

Today's ONS update showed that all English regions, and Wales, saw a higher number of registered deaths than the five-year average.

North West England had 615 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in the week ending November 13 – the highest number for the region since the week ending May 15.

LOSS OF TASTE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IN SECOND WAVE A lost sense of taste was the most common symptom among people with coronavirus in England's second wave, Office for National Statistics data suggests. The ONS analysed reports of symptoms among people getting swabbed in its mass testing programme between August and October. Symptoms around the time of the test were considered. It compared how often people with a certain symptom tested positive, and how often people with certain symptoms tested positive for the virus. It found that loss of taste was far more common among positive cases than coughs or fevers, which are seen as the more typical and obvious signs of Covid-19. Between 35 and 45 per cent of people testing positive for coronavirus lost their sense of taste, the ONS found. Its graphs suggested that as many as 45 per cent of people between the ages of 18 and 35 experienced the effect, compared to 30 per cent of older or younger age groups. By comparison, fever was found in around 10-20 per cent of people, and coughing in 10 per cent or fewer. The report said people with symptoms tested positive more often than those without: 'The positivity rates in those with specific symptoms or other evidence of symptoms are higher than those not reporting any evidence of symptoms.' It added in a series of caveats that the symptoms were self-reported and not diagnosed by a doctor, and that they did not include those among people who were in hospitals or care homes.

In Yorkshire and the Humber, 450 Covid-19 deaths were registered in that week, while there were 284 in the West Midlands and 245 in the East Midlands.

Weekly registered deaths not involving Covid-19 were below the five-year average for the third consecutive week, the ONS said.

A total of 68,524 deaths have so far been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, according to the latest reports from the UK’s statistics agencies.

This includes 62,162 deaths in England and Wales up to November 13 which were confirmed by the ONS on Tuesday.

Since these statistics were compiled, a further 2,432 deaths are known to have occurred in England, plus 80 in Scotland, 128 in Wales and 91 in Northern Ireland, according to additional data published on the Government’s coronavirus dashboard.

Together, these totals mean that so far 71,255 deaths involving Covid-19 have taken place in the UK, when figures from the statistical bodies of Scotland and Northern Ireland are also included.

These are deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.

Of all deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales, around two thirds occurred in hospital, (40,062 deaths), the figures show.

The remainder occurred in care homes (16,849 deaths), private homes (2,927 deaths), hospices (833 deaths), other communal establishments (242 deaths) and elsewhere (223 deaths).

More than 30,000 excess deaths not linked to Covid-19 have occurred in private homes since the start of the pandemic.

There were 30,785 non-Covid excess deaths in homes in England and Wales registered between March 7 and November 13, the ONS said.

In a separate report published this morning the ONS revealed that a lost sense of taste was the most common symptom among people with coronavirus in England's second wave.

The ONS analysed reports of symptoms among people getting swabbed in its mass testing programme between August and October.

It compared how often people with a certain symptom tested positive, and how often people with certain symptoms tested positive for the virus.

# Anxiety Associated With Faster Alzheimer’s Disease Onset

Summary: Anxiety may accelerate the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. Brain scans revealed patients who progressed from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease had decreased volume in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

Anxiety is associated with an increased rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study being presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Alzheimer’s disease represents a major public health crisis worldwide. The number of deaths from the disease has more than doubled since 2000, and it is currently the fifth-leading cause of death among individuals over 65 in the U.S.

Many people with Alzheimer’s disease first suffer from mild cognitive impairment, a decline in cognitive abilities like memory and thinking skills that is more rapid than normally associated with aging. Anxiety has been frequently observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment, although its role in disease progression is not well understood.

“We know that volume loss in certain areas of the brain is a factor that predicts progression to Alzheimer’s disease,” said study senior author Maria Vittoria Spampinato, M.D., professor of radiology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston. “In this study, we wanted to see if anxiety had an effect on brain structure, or if the effect of anxiety was independent from brain structure in favoring the progression of disease.”

The study group included 339 patients, average age of 72 years, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 cohort. Each person had a baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment; 72 progressed to Alzheimer’s disease while 267 remained stable.

The researchers obtained brain MRIs to determine the baseline volumes of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, two areas important to forming memories. They also tested for the presence of the ApoE4 allele, the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Anxiety was measured with established clinical surveys.

As expected, patients who progressed to Alzheimer’s disease had significantly lower volumes in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex and greater frequency of the ApoE4 allele. Most notably though, the researchers found that anxiety was independently associated with cognitive decline.

“Mild cognitive impairment patients with anxiety symptoms developed Alzheimer’s disease faster than individuals without anxiety, independently of whether they had a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease or brain volume loss,” said study first author Jenny L. Ulber, a medical student at MUSC.

The link between anxiety symptoms and a faster progression to Alzheimer’s disease presents an opportunity for improving the screening and management of patients with early mild cognitive impairment, the researchers said.

“We need to better understand the association between anxiety disorders and cognitive decline,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We don’t know yet if the anxiety is a symptom–in other words, their memory is getting worse and they become anxious–or if anxiety contributes to cognitive decline. If we were able in the future to find that anxiety is actually causing progression, then we should more aggressively screen for anxiety disorders in the elderly.”

“The geriatric population is routinely screened for depression in many hospitals, but perhaps this vulnerable population should also be assessed for anxiety disorders,” Ulber added. “Middle-aged and elderly individuals with high level of anxiety may benefit from intervention, whether it be pharmacological or cognitive behavioral therapy, with the goal of slowing cognitive decline.”

The study was based on MRI scans done at one point in time. For future research, the team would like to study MRIs obtained after the initial scan to better understand the connection between anxiety and brain structure.

“We’re now interested in looking at changes over time to see if anxiety has an effect one way or the other on how fast the brain damage progresses,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We will also take a closer look at gender differences in the association between anxiety and cognitive decline.”

# Tired All the Time? It Could Be Your Diabetes

If you’re coping with diabetes and feel wiped out all the time — the kind of fatigue that isn’t helped by eating or getting a little extra sleep — it’s possible that type 2 diabetes is what’s dragging you down.

After all, people with type 2 diabetes are roughly 10 times more likely to experience fatigue compared with those without the chronic condition, according to a study on adults with the condition.

“Glucose is a major source of energy for all cells in our body, especially the brain,” explains Deena Adimoolam, MD, an endocrinologist at Mount Sinai in New York City and a spokesperson for the Endocrine Society. “With type 2 diabetes, though, glucose levels are high and the glucose is unable to enter the cells, meaning the cells have less energy overall to function. As a result, one experiences generalized fatigue.” To make matters worse, both excessively high and low blood sugar levels can further spur fatigue, she says.

But that’s not the end of it. “Fatigue with type 2 diabetes is usually multifactorial,” Dr. Adimoolam says. In fact, research shows that stress, depression, increased body mass index (BMI), and a lack of exercise can all be significant contributors to fatigue in people with type 2 diabetes. Adimoolam notes that all of these factors can independently decrease insulin sensitivity, making it even harder for insulin to deliver glucose from the bloodstream into tissues, including those in the heart, brain, and muscles.

Meanwhile, many people with type 2 diabetes also have coexisting conditions such as heart disease, kidney damage, and dehydration; these can further increase fatigue, according to Adimoolam. Many medications for hypertension are known to cause fatigue.

Diabetes Fatigue: How to Get Your Energy Back

Take a proactive approach to dealing with fatigue by addressing your symptoms and concerns with your healthcare providers and support team. Following these steps can help:

Talk to your doctor. First things first: Evaluate your blood sugar levels and work with your primary care doctor or endocrinologist to get them into healthy ranges, if they aren’t already. If your blood sugar is in a healthy range, however, it’s important to work with your doctor to figure out exactly what’s going on for you, Adimoolam says.

When talking to your doctor about how you feel, don’t just say, “I’m tired all the time.” Tell your doctor, 'I’m too tired to go for a walk or go grocery shopping,'” says Cynthia Fritschi, PhD, CDCES, an associate professor of biobehavioral nursing science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Let your doctor know that exhaustion is preventing you from doing activities that are important to keeping you healthy.

Try keeping a journal to track your symptoms: How many times do you get up at night to go to the bathroom? Are you skipping meals because you’re too tired to stand and prepare them? Take detailed notes on your daily habits and use your journal to talk to your doctor or diabetes educator about concerns that make living with type 2 diabetes harder for you, she says.

RELATED: Do You Have Type 2 Diabetes Burnout?

Be as active as possible. “One of the key strategies for taking care of diabetes is exercise, yet people with diabetes can be too tired to exercise,"" Fritschi says.

Fortunately, you don’t have to perform intense workouts to enjoy an energy and mood boost from exercise: Any form of regular physical activity, regardless of exercise limitations, reduces stress, according to a study published in June 2018 in the Journal of Exercise Rehabilitation. Set small, achievable activity goals, such as taking a daily walk or stretching, and increase your movement goals as you feel able.

Care for your mental health. Managing diabetes is a 24/7 commitment. That alone can cause you to feel anxious, stressed, or depressed. And, in turn, depression can lead to fatigue and a lack of energy, Fritschi says. According to a study of 90,686 people published in the February-March 2016 issue of the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, people with diabetes are 2 to 3 times more likely to experience depression compared with people without the condition.

If you feel burdened and depressed by diabetes, consider getting professional help. A therapist who is trained in treating depression can help you improve your mental health. Ask your doctor or diabetes educator for a recommendation.

Connect with your peers. Talking with others affected by diabetes can also provide some relief. Discussing day-to-day challenges, worries, and emotions with peers who have experienced similar situations can help you manage stress and brainstorm coping strategies, suggests the American Diabetes Association. Ask your diabetes educator about local support groups or become a member of an diabetes online community for virtual conversation.

RELATED: The Best Diabetes Apps of the Year

Aim for quality sleep. As many as half of all people with diabetes may have trouble sleeping, Fritschi says. Stress, anxiety, and depression can all contribute to insomnia, while frequently having to wake up in the night to urinate can also worsen overall sleep quality.

If you’re not sleeping well at night, you're going to be tired during the day. Modifying your evening routine and sleep environment can help you get more rest, she says. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends; keep your bedroom cool and dark; and turn off electronics (the computer and the TV) before going to bed, recommends the National Sleep Foundation. If you are concerned you may have a sleep disorder, speak with your doctor about evaluating your sleep.

# Laughing is good for your mind and your body – here’s what the research shows

Amusement and pleasant surprises – and the laughter they can trigger – add texture to the fabric of daily life.

Those giggles and guffaws can seem like just silly throwaways. But laughter, in response to funny events, actually takes a lot of work, because it activates many areas of the brain: areas that control motor, emotional, cognitive and social processing.

As I found when writing “An Introduction to the Psychology of Humor,” researchers now appreciate laughter’s power to enhance physical and mental well-being.

Laughter’s physical power

People begin laughing in infancy, when it helps develop muscles and upper body strength. Laughter is not just breathing. It relies on complex combinations of facial muscles, often involving movement of the eyes, head and shoulders.

Laughter – doing it or observing it – activates multiple regions of the brain: the motor cortex, which controls muscles; the frontal lobe, which helps you understand context; and the limbic system, which modulates positive emotions. Turning all these circuits on strengthens neural connections and helps a healthy brain coordinate its activity.

By activating the neural pathways of emotions like joy and mirth, laughter can improve your mood and make your physical and emotional response to stress less intense. For example, laughing may help control brain levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, similar to what antidepressants do. By minimizing your brain’s responses to threats, it limits the release of neurotransmitters and hormones like cortisol that can wear down your cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems over time. Laughter’s kind of like an antidote to stress, which weakens these systems and increases vulnerability to diseases.

Laughter’s cognitive power

A good sense of humor and the laughter that follows depend on an ample measure of social intelligence and working memory resources.

Laughter, like humor, typically sparks from recognizing the incongruities or absurdities of a situation. You need to mentally resolve the surprising behavior or event – otherwise you won’t laugh; you might just be confused instead. Inferring the intentions of others and taking their perspective can enhance the intensity of the laughter and amusement you feel.

To “get” a joke or humorous situation, you need to be able to see the lighter side of things. You must believe that other possibilities besides the literal exist – think about being amused by comic strips with talking animals, like those found in “The Far Side.”

Laughter’s social power

Many cognitive and social skills work together to help you monitor when and why laughter occurs during conversations. You don’t even need to hear a laugh to be able to laugh. Deaf signers punctuate their signed sentences with laughter, much like emoticons in written text.

Laughter creates bonds and increases intimacy with others. Linguist Don Nilsen points out that chuckles and belly laughs seldom happen when alone, supporting their strong social role. Beginning early in life, infants’ laughter is an external sign of pleasure that helps strengthen bonds with caregivers.

Later, it’s an external sign of sharing an appreciation of the situation. For example, public speakers and comedians try to get a laugh to make audiences feel psychologically closer to them, to create intimacy.

By practicing a little laughter each day, you can enhance social skills that may not come naturally to you. When you laugh in response to humor, you share your feelings with others and learn from risks that your response will be accepted/shared/enjoyed by others and not be rejected/ignored/disliked.

In studies, psychologists have found that men with Type A personality characteristics, including competitiveness and time urgency, tend to laugh more, while women with those traits laugh less. Both sexes laugh more with others than when alone.

Positive psychology researchers study how people can live meaningful lives and thrive. Laughter produces positive emotions that lead to this kind of flourishing. These feelings – like amusement, happiness, mirth and joy – build resiliency and increase creative thinking. They increase subjective well-being and life satisfaction. Researchers find that these positive emotions experienced with humor and laughter correlate with appreciating the meaning of life and help older adults hold a benign view of difficulties they’ve faced over a lifetime.

Laughter in response to amusement is a healthy coping mechanism. When you laugh, you take yourself or the situation less seriously and may feel empowered to problem-solve. For example, psychologists measured the frequency and intensity of 41 people’s laughter over two weeks, along with their ratings of physical and mental stress. They found that the more laughter experienced, the lower the reported stress. Whether the instances of laughter were strong, medium or weak in intensity didn’t matter.

Maybe you want to grab some of these benefits for yourself – can you force laughter to work for you?

A growing number of therapists advocate using humor and laughter to help clients build trust and improve work environments; a review of five different studies found that measures of well-being did increase after laughter interventions. Sometimes called homeplay instead of homework, these interventions take the form of daily humor activities – surrounding yourself with funny people, watching a comedy that makes you laugh or writing down three funny things that happened today.

[Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.]

You can practice laughing even when alone. Intentionally take a perspective that appreciates the funny side of events. Laughing yoga is a technique of using breathing muscles to achieve the positive physical responses of natural laughing with forced laughter (ha ha hee hee ho ho).

Researchers today certainly aren’t laughing off its value, but a good deal of the research on laughter’s influence on mental and physical health is based on self-report measures. More psychological experimentation around laughter or the contexts in which it occurs will likely support the importance of laughing throughout your day, and maybe even suggest more ways to intentionally harness its benefits.

# Coronavirus UK: Sussex and Herefordshire cases soar as Tiers decided

Advertisement

An interactive module has today revealed how quickly coronavirus outbreaks are growing in every local authority in England as millions wait for Boris Johnson to declare which areas will be subject to Tier Three restrictions when the second national lockdown ends next week.

As Britain approached Autumn only five of around 200 local authorities had a weekly Covid-19 infection rate above 100 cases per 100,000 people. Only 24 areas still have an infection rate that is in the double figures.

East Sussex, Herefordshire and Milton Keynes were the local authorities in England that suffered the biggest spikes in coronavirus cases during the most recent week, making them among the most likely to enter Tier Three rules that force restaurants to move to takeaway only.

Public Health England statistics show infection rates — the number of new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people — shot up by at least 50 per cent in all three areas in the seven-day spell ending November 15. Kent, parts of Essex and London also saw large rises, according to the data MailOnline has used to make an interactive tool.

Meanwhile, the areas that saw the greatest falls in cases were almost all in Tier Three in the North West, adding further evidence that the local lockdown system appears to work. Warrington, Oldham, Wigan and Blackburn, all of which suffered huge numbers of infections during England's second wave, saw declines of 30 per cent or more.

Boris Johnson last night confirmed the country's second draconian lockdown will end on December 2, with No10 opting to return to a revamped three-tier system that could have to remain in place until at least March 31 — more than a year after the first lockdown began.

Ministers are waiting for the most up-to-date data to decide what brackets individual authorities will be placed in, with the breakdown set to be published on Thursday. Policymakers will analyse rates of infections, test positivity and speed of outbreak growth to decide on the measures.

The worst-hit areas including Hull and the North West are expected to be placed under the toughest Tier Three, which forces restaurants and pubs to shut — unless they offer takeaways.

Debate rages on over which bracket London should be in, with the capital's mayor Sadiq Khan predicting the city will face Tier Two — which bans mixing indoors with other households. But senior Tories including Sir Iain Duncan Smith last night demanded the city, the beating heart of the UK's economy, is put under Tier One.

Northern mayors have voiced opposition to plans to put them into higher tiers, with Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham saying they could trigger 'widespread business failure' in the region. MPs have warned T2 and T3 will be 'catastrophic' for businesses and spark a damaging new mutiny.

Whitehall sources told the Daily Mail last night that very few areas would be afforded Tier One restrictions, with only the rural regions — such as Cornwall and South Oxfordshire — likely to see the lightest rules applied.

Britain today recorded 11,299 Covid-19 cases in the lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks, but deaths rose again to 608 which is the highest toll since May.

‹ Slide me › Above are infections before winter in September (right) and those on November 18 (left) after the second lockdown

Covid-19 cases have fallen across most of the North of England since lockdown was imposed, but they are rising in a corner of the South East. The percentage change is based on comparing data from the week ending November 15 to the week ending November 8. It comes as the Government prepares to unveil its tier system

The onerous tiered system will be in place across England from December 3 until the end of March, the Prime Minister said

COVID RESTRICTIONS WILL BE EASED OVER CHRISTMAS FOR FIVE DAYS, OFFICIALS CONFIRM Coronavirus restrictions will be eased across the UK for five days at Christmas to allow up to three households to meet indoors after the four home nations agreed a joint plan to loosen draconian curbs over the festive period. A four-nation meeting of the Cobra emergency committee agreed the proposals this afternoon. The relaxed measures will be in place from Wednesday December 23 to Sunday December 27, paving the way for families in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to meet up. It came after Nicola Sturgeon had earlier suggested the Christmas respite from coronavirus lockdown would not be entirely the same in Scotland. The First Minister said she hoped there would be an agreement on a 'common framework' for the festive season. But she hinted at splits between the nations saying the 'precise definition of household' is likely to vary. Scotland currently has different rules on gatherings compared to England, including not including under-12s in limits on numbers. Meanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has admitted that loosening the restrictions over Christmas will inevitably lead to more cases of the deadly disease. Frantic efforts have been going on for days to find a joint position for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to allow some kind of family Christmas. Advertisement

In other major developments today:

Sir Jeremy Farrar, from the Wellcome Trust and a member of SAGE, said there was enough data for Britain to lockdown in January;

Today 11,299 Covid-19 cases were recorded in the lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks, but deaths rose to 608 in highest toll since May.

The Prime Minister warned last night: 'We expect more regions to fall, at least temporally, into higher levels than before but by using these tougher tiers and by using rapid turnaround tests on an ever greater scale to drive R below one.'

But he added the toughened tiers should make it possible for local authorities 'to move down the tier-ing scale to lower levels of restrictions' as cases start to plummet.

The previous system was heavily criticised for putting areas into Tier Three and then seemingly giving them no clear-cut way out of the curbs.

Toughest restrictions are likely to be applied to areas with the highest infection rates as well as those that have been growing the fastest in recent weeks.

Public Health England data shows a North-South divide that is seeing positive rates increasing faster in parts of the South of the country and in London, while rates are highest – but falling fastest – in the North.

This is likely a legacy of the original three-tier system which saw much of Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire thrust into the toughest local rules before the national lockdown while much of the South didn't have any at all.

North Lincolnshire was the only part of the country further north than the Midlands that featured in the top 20 places with the fastest rate of increase in the week up to November 15. The data counts positive test results that came through the Department of Health's official testing programme.

Ten of the top 20 were boroughs of London – Greenwich, Enfield, Merton, Croydon, Havering, Camden, Hammersmith & Fulham, Bromley, Kingston upon Thames and Hackney & the City of London.

Other areas that saw their positive case counts increase by 25 per cent or more in a week were East Sussex, Herefordshire, Milton Keynes, Kent, Medway, Southend-on-Sea, Slough, North Lincolnshire, Bedford and Cornwall.

Meanwhile, 17 out of the 20 areas that saw the biggest falls in their infection rates during the same week were all ones that were in Tier Three, with the exception only of Torbay in Devon, North East Lincolnshire and Derby.

Local authorities which had been in the toughest local rules before England's national lockdown on November 5 but then saw infections drop by 18 per cent or more in the second week of November were: St Helens, Wirral, Knowsley and Warrington in Merseyside; Manchester, Bury, Tameside, Rochdale, Trafford, Salford, Wigan and Oldham in Greater Manchester; and Doncaster, Sheffield, Nottingham and Blackburn with Darwen.

WHAT ARE THE NEW TIER RULES? Tier One will be the default and measures will not be allowed to get more relaxed in any part of England: Rule of six and social distancing apply to gatherings indoors and outdoors;

Pubs and restaurants are allowed to open with table service only and an 11pm closing time. Tier Two: People from separate households cannot meet indoors and the rule of six applies outside;

Pubs must close unless operating as restaurants, with alcoholic drinks served alongside meals; Tier Three will be the toughest level of restrictions and rules have been tightened up to make them stricter than before. All of the Tier Two rules apply as well as the following: Indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, theatres and bowling alleys must close;

Pubs, restaurants and cafes must close except for takeaway;

Shops and hairdressers and salons will be allowed to remain open;

Groups of six will be allowed to meet outdoors only;

Crowds at live events will be banned;

People should avoid travelling out of, or into, Tier Three areas unless it is unavoidable. Advertisement

Politicians and local leaders are today gathering to mount substantial challenges to the restrictions.

In the capital, Tory heavyweight Sir Iain has told the Telegraph that it 'must' be placed in Tier One to revive the country.

'London is dominant in the economy and we need it to get back to work immediately,' he said.

Another London MP told the Guardian they were 'fiercely lobbying' for pubs, bars and restaurants to be re-opened in the capital.

Sadiq Khan told LBC yesterday: 'It's a bit early to say yet, but based on the numbers that I've seen, which is a slowdown in the virus spreading, it's coming down in parts of London in a couple of boroughs.'

'What I hope would happen is... London would probably be in what is called Tier Two.'

None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures from the seven-day spell ending November 15, the latest date for which data is available.

But in 20 of the 32 boroughs the infection rate rose last week, with the biggest jumps in Havering, Enfield and Redbridge.

The highest infection rate is in Havering, in the north-east of the city, the only borough where they surged above 300 per 100,000.

The number of patients being rushed to hospital in the capital suffering from Covid-19 remains low, according to the Department of Health, at a seven-day average of 154.7 admissions on November 17. But this is far below the peak of the first wave, when on average 748 patients were being taken to hospital with Covid-19 every day.

These levels are also among the lowest in the country, which ministers are expected to argue mean that London can be spared the sharpest curbs on public freedoms.

Mayors in the North of England are also mounting opposition to yet again being placed under higher tiers, with Sheffield city leader Dan Jarvis warning: 'We're willing to do our bit, but we must not be taken for granted.'

Daily hospitalisation rates with Covid-19 across England Region North East&Yorks Midland North West London South East South West East of England Daily admissions 360.7 354.7 239.4 154.7 150.3 110.4 97.9 % change -8.2% -5.5% -14.8% +12.3% +9.5% -8.3% +6.1% This data is based on the latest figures from the Department of Health. Daily admissions is the seven-day average of admissions to November 17. And % change is based on the difference between the average on November 17 and November 10. Advertisement

He added: 'Tougher restrictions have had a massive impact on South Yorkshire's economy.

'The Government said it will return to its levelling up agenda after the pandemic, but the brutal reality is we cannot wait that long.

'At Wednesday's Spending Review, the Government has a golden opportunity to deliver on its promises.

'I've pressed Ministers to bring forward major investment, to give the North the best chance of weathering the storm, ensure businesses survive a tough winter and allow us to kick start the job of economic recovery and renewal.'

Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham has come out hard against being plunged into the toughest measures.

Mr Burnham said a toughened Tier Three 'could be devastating for the hospitality industry and will hit cities and the city economy very, very hard indeed'.

Across England Swale, in Kent, has the worst infection rate in the country at 631.7 per 100,000.

Local leaders there have spoken of their 'frustration' that residents appear not to be following restrictions, and taking simple precautions such as wearing a face mask.

Swale's council leader, Roger Truelove, said lockdown rules in the borough were being 'willfully disregarded', with residents regularly not wearing face coverings and ignoring social distancing.

An emergency council meeting was held yesterday to discuss why the district - which is home to about 150,000 and includes the Isle of Sheppey - has seen such rapid growth of the virus.

THERE WAS ENOUGH INFORMATION ON COVID-19 TO ACT IN JANUARY, SAYS SCIENTIST Enough was known about coronavirus in January to act straight away, but the response was delayed, a leading scientist has said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said that while information about the virus was 'uncertain', action could have been taken. At the start of January the World Health Organisation was aware of a cluster of pneumonia cases - with no deaths - in Wuhan, China, and shared detailed information with member states. Speaking at the Imperial College London's Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics's (J-IDEA) symposium on a post-Covid world, Sir Jeremy said the response to the information was delayed. He said: 'The information you have early may be uncertain, but it's enough to act on. 'I would say that at the end of January we knew enough to have acted. And we waited. 'We waited out of uncertainty, we wanted to be more certain than we needed to be. 'But by the end of January, we knew that this was able to transmit asymptomatically, that it caused a nasty clinical syndrome and a significant number of people were dying, that healthcare workers were getting sick and distant family members were getting sick when people moved from Wuhan to Sichuan, that this was going out of China into other parts of south-east Asia, that we had no diagnostics, no treatment and no vaccines. 'To me, at the time - and this is not in retrospect - I think that was enough to have acted then in ways that we delayed.' Advertisement

The latest analysis of PHE figures, by the Press Association news agency, found Covid-19 case rates started to fall in most local areas across England in the most recent week, up to November 15.

Only two of nine regions - London and the South East - are still recording week-on-week rises in cases. The full impact of England's second national lockdown, however, is yet to become apparent in the data.

It takes up to two weeks for someone who has caught the virus to show symptoms, get tested, and receive a positive result. This means that many infections currently being reported may have occurred before the emergency measures were brought in.

But the latest figures suggest the numbers are heading in the right direction, though not in all parts of England.

The nationwide restrictions began on November 5, and the most recent figures are for the week ending November 15 – just 14 days into the lockdown.

Infection surges were recorded in 34 out of 67 local authorities in the South East, with Medway seeing the biggest jump.

Medway, in Kent, had the sixth biggest surge in infections in the country when they rose by 39.3 per cent to 299 per 100,000.

But the biggest week-on-week falls were recorded in the North West - signalling that earlier measures were helping to drive down cases alongside the lockdown.

Warrington saw the biggest fall in England, where infections dropped by 32.5 per cent to 259.6 per 100,000.

It was followed by Oldham, in Greater Manchester, where infections fell by 30.7 per cent to 519.2 per 100,000.

And Wigan saw the third biggest fall with a 30.3 per cent drop to 403.2 per 100,000.

When the tiered system returns on December 3, they will be reviewed every two weeks to establish whether local authorities need to have stricter curbs imposed or can be dropped to lower restrictions.

It is set to be in place until March 31, at which point the tiered system will come to an end.

Boris Johnson said last night that he hoped the country would be able to get back to normal 'by Easter', predicting this could be when the elderly and most vulnerable members of the population will have received a Covid-19 vaccine.

Three vaccines - including Oxford's jab - have said they are at least 70 per cent effective at triggering an immune response, prompting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to say 'the end of the tunnel' of the pandemic is in sight.

GRANT SHAPPS URGES BRITONS NOT TO USE TRAINS AT CHRISTMAS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE TOO BUSY Grant Shapps today urged Britons not to use trains at Christmas because they will be 'too busy' - as UK ministers meet to thrash out a plan to ease coronavirus rules so family reunions can happen. An announcement is imminent on proposals for a loosening over the festive season, with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove due to chair a Cobra meeting with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But the Transport Secretary has warned that the rail network's 'limitations', with major engineering work and capacity constraints, mean people should avoid using it where possible. In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Shapps said: 'We are going to be appealing to people to look very carefully at the transport route they take and of course even making a choice about whether they travel at all.' News on how restrictions on socialising will be relaxed for a few days - probably from December 23-27 - had been expected today, but might now come later in the week, as sources say 'details need ironing out'. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there could be a 'slight and careful' easing of the rules for a few days while Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething has suggested tough measures to control the virus before Christmas could allow 'more headroom for the festive season'. Mr Gove is set to chair a meeting with the devolved administrations later, in a bid to get the package over the line. Advertisement

The UK has ordered 100million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, with up to four million set to arrive this year. It is also expecting the first part of a delivery of 40million doses from Pfizer and BioNtech - who say their vaccine is 90 per cent effective - by the end of the year, and five million doses from Moderna - with a 94.5 per cent effective shot - in the spring next year.

Leaked NHS plans reveal they could start vaccinating the elderly and most vulnerable against the virus in early December, with vaccines being rolled out to the rest of the population in the new year.

But scientists have urged caution, warning none of the jabs have yet been approved for use by the UK's regulator the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The regulator reviews data on vaccine effectiveness and how safe it is before deciding whether or not to allow it to be administered across the country. It is a process that usually takes two years but, amid pressure to get life back to normal, the regulator has said it is working hard to make a decision quickly.

The Prime Minister detailed his winter strategy yesterday, with a plan to deploy a major testing scheme in an attempt to win over rebels on the Conservative backbenches.

He told tell MPs that non-essential shops can open in all three tiers after the current restrictions expire on December 2, in a boost for retailers.

Mr Johnson also set out the basis of plans to allow a small number of households across the UK to mix over a limited number of days around Christmas.

Vaccines and tiers – all your questions answered

When are we coming out of national lockdown?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the national lockdown imposed on November 5 will come to an end on December 2.

However, England will then move back into a regional tiered system of restrictions – similar to those introduced earlier this year.

What is the tier system?

There are three different tiers of restrictions, which will be imposed at a regional level depending on the number of coronavirus cases in that area.

Those living under Tier 1 restrictions will have the greatest freedoms, while people in Tiers 2 and 3 will face stricter measures.

Official testing data shows that coronavirus infection rates are falling across the North of England, where they were highest during the peak of the second wave, but they remain high in some areas of the West Midlands, Kent, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire (Darker colours indicate higher rates of positive tests per 100,000 people)

LONDON LOCKDOWN REVOLT: MPS WARN PUTTING CAPITAL IN T3 WOULD BE A 'DISASTER' In 20 of London's 32 regions last week there were increases in infection rates. The biggest jumps being Havering (up from 309.4 to 386.0), Enfield (up from 175.6 to 230.4) and Redbridge (up from 249.0 to 300.4) Boris Johnson has been warned by furious London Tories that it would be an economic 'disaster' if the capital was hit with the toughest possible coronavirus restrictions after lockdown ends. City MPs and the Conservative candidate for mayor, Shaun Bailey, sent the Prime Minister a clear warning after it emerged officials could place the metropolis into the top Tier 3 after December 2. They warned such a move could cripple London's entertainment and hospitality industries, with pubs and restaurants open for takeaway and delivery sales only and theatres and other venues remaining closed. None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures. But speaking to business leaders via Zoom last night, Mr Bailey said: 'I absolutely agree it would be a disaster for London if we were in Tier 3. Advertisement

How will they decide on what tier to introduce?

Regions with high numbers of cases will face tighter measures, while those with fewer cases will have their restrictions relaxed.

To decide which tier to apply to a specific area, officials will look at coronavirus cases across all age groups, and specifically among the over-60s who are considered most at risk.

They will also consider whether infection rates are rising or falling and the prevalence of the disease per 100,000 of the population.

When will I find out what tier I'm in?

An announcement will be made on Thursday.

What is allowed under each tier?

Under Tier 1, people can meet a maximum of six friends or family outdoors or indoors.

Pubs and restaurants can reopen, but with table service only and an 11pm closing time.

In Tier 2, people from two different households cannot mix indoors, and outdoor gatherings will be limited to six.

Pubs will remain closed unless operating as restaurants, with alcohol only served as part of a 'substantial meal'.

Retail and personal care – such as hairdressers and beauty salons – can reopen in all tiers, and indoor entertainment venues – such as cinemas, theatres, bowling alleys and casinos – will be allowed to stay open in Tiers 1 and 2, but not Tier 3.

Tier 3 areas will see the hospitality sector remain closed except for takeaways, and groups of six will only be able to meet in outdoor public spaces.

Can I travel between tiers?

People in Tier 3 areas should avoid travelling to other parts of the UK, including for overnight stays unless it is for work, education, health or care requirements.

Likewise, those in Tier 1 and 2 areas should not travel to Tier 3 zones, but can pass through them as part of a longer journey.

Should I start making plans for Christmas?

Not just yet. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was unable to confirm on Monday any details as to how people would be able to spend the festive period.

However, a plan to allow families to be reunited for Christmas is being developed with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

HANCOCK CLAIMS T3 WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH BEFORE LOCKDOWN Matt Hancock has claimed Tier Three restrictions imposed before lockdown were not tough enough to halt the spread of Covid-19, and revealed he hopes damaging restrictions on Britons lives will be lifted after Easter. Speaking to Parliament's Health and Social Care Committee, the 'architect' of the tiered system said he was convinced a second lockdown was needed when cases suddenly surged in all areas of England. The then-spiralling numbers, he said, meant that 'even in the lower prevalence areas you could see they were going to get to high prevalence if we didn't act'. Public Health England data reveals the sharpest spike in infections across England was in the week ending October 4, when almost every local authority saw Covid-19 infections surge by more than 50 per cent. Ministers then rushed out the tiered system - which came into force on October 14 - in an attempt to suppress escalating cases. But just 23 days later - and amid growing evidence that Tier Three was driving down infections - they hit the nuclear button and imposed a second nationwide lockdown. The Health Secretary and Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove are thought to have been the main supporters of the stringent measures in the cabinet. Mr Hancock appeared today in front of the committee to answer questions on the Government's handling of the pandemic, including whether Test and Trace is working, whether the first lockdown was imposed early enough and why a circuit breaker was avoided. Boris Johnson yesterday unveiled his beefed-up tier system, with Tier Three now forcing all restaurants and bars to shift to take-away only. Advertisement

Is there a vaccine yet?

Not quite. Although vaccine developers have started to publish the interim results from their trials, which have so far been positive.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca team announced its vaccine had proved up to 90% effective.

When will it be ready?

No one can be certain at this stage as no vaccine has been approved for use yet.

But the jab is likely to be rolled out in the UK from December, with the bulk of vaccination in the new year.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, if all goes well in the next couple of weeks, the vaccination programme could potentially be rolled out from next month for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.

Will I have to pay for a jab?

No, the vaccine will be free on the NHS.

Will there be enough for everyone?

The Government said it has secured access to more than 350 million doses of vaccine from seven developers between now and the end of 2021, which is enough to potentially vaccinate the whole population.

Do I have to get a vaccine?

There are no plans to make vaccination compulsory, Downing Street said earlier in November.

However, Mr Hancock has also refused to rule out making it mandatory.

How long will immunity last?

The Government said in its Covid Winter Plan that the exact strength and duration of immunity provided through vaccination is not yet known.

Protection through vaccination takes time to build and requires a full course, but it is still unknown how well the first vaccines will stop the virus from passing between people.

Can I choose what vaccine I get?

As things stand, the vaccines will be rolled out as and when they become available, depending on which are approved first and how quickly companies can make them.

No announcement has been made on whether one might be given priority over another as they become ready on a mass scale.

People are not expected to be able to choose which jab they want to receive.

When will life return to normal?

While it is not known exactly how long it might take for the population to be vaccinated, Mr Hancock has said it is looking as though things may start returning to normal after Easter.

But until then, and until there is some kind of herd immunity in the population, achieved through vaccination, people will need to continue to wear face masks, socially distance and wash their hands.";"(2020-10-30)

# Coronavirus Today: ‘Band-Aids on a very big wound’

Good evening. I’m Amina Khan, and it’s Tuesday, Nov. 24. Here’s what’s happening with the coronavirus in California and beyond.

As the world’s worst pandemic in more than a century rages, how should we try to manage a safer Thanksgiving?

It’s a question at the top of many Americans’ minds this week, and my colleague Rong-Gong Lin II is, dependably, here with the answers for you.

The lowest-risk option is to cancel those travel plans, stay home for Thanksgiving and not travel, according to a panoply of federal, state and local officials. And “travel” includes everything from flying across the country to walking down the street to a neighbor’s home. The point is to keep households from mixing and inadvertently transmitting the coronavirus to one another.

“The safest way to celebrate Thanksgiving is to celebrate at home with the people you live with,” said Barbara Ferrer, director of public health for Los Angeles County.

College students returning home just for the Thanksgiving holiday are a particularly risky bunch, especially if their homes include family members who are elderly or have common medical issues like high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, or kidney and lung disease. Keep in mind, people who are infected but don’t feel sick can be highly contagious and easily infect others, who could then develop severe complications and even die from COVID-19.

If you plan an extended stay, you should quarantine yourself in a room alone for 14 days, avoid sharing a bathroom (or clean it every time you do share one), eat alone and have everyone at home wear masks all the time when indoors.

“The tighter you can restrict your activities over those 14 days, the better off we all are,” Ferrer said.

Remember, a negative coronavirus test can be misleading. All it means is that the test didn’t detect the virus in your body. It could still be there, but at levels too low to pick up. This can happen early in infection, before the virus has a chance to make enough copies of itself to trigger a positive test result.

That’s why “you can’t ‘test out’ of quarantine, as much as people would like to,” Ferrer said. “Because it’s a 14-day incubation period, that really means that from the time of your last exposure to the virus ... it could take the full 14 days for you to be able to actually test positive for the virus.”

If you do decide to hold a Thanksgiving meal anyway with folks from other households, there are ways to mitigate the worst coronavirus risks. For example, California has announced certain requirements and recommendations for gatherings in counties in the most restrictive “purple” tier of the state’s pandemic reopening plan. Among them:

Advertisement

• Gatherings must be held outside and involve people from no more than three households. (In Los Angeles County, they are also limited to no more than 15 people.)

• The gathering space must be large enough for everyone to maintain at least a six-foot distance from others who don’t live in their household.

• Food and beverages must be served by someone who wears a face covering and washes their hands often.

• Face coverings must be worn, and removed only when people are actively eating or drinking.

Advertisement

• Gatherings should be kept to two hours or less. The longer an event, the higher the risk of transmission, authorities say.

Across California

California has completely smashed its past daily record for coronavirus cases, coming in with 20,654 new infections on Monday — far above the previous all-pandemic record of 13,400 infections. Los Angeles County also posted a daily record of more than 6,000 new cases.

Over the last five days, the state has logged a total of 65,168 new coronavirus cases, according to data compiled by The Times. That’s nearly three times as high as the 24,263 new cases recorded in the state during the five-day period that ended Oct. 23, just a month ago.

This major surge has moved the state into troubling new ground right on the cusp of the Thanksgiving holiday, which could touch off another round of super-spreading events.

The number of COVID-19 hospitalizations climbed roughly 82% from two weeks earlier, to 5,459. Coronavirus-related intensive care admissions also rose 59% over the same period, to 1,333, state data show.

It’s not just records being shattered, said L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. Lives are being shattered alongside them.

“There’s too much transmission happening here right now in this county — too much transmission with too many meetings of too many people,” Garcetti said. “So the solution is simple; we know it, and we can do it: Stay away from each other. Assume everybody you would see is infectious and, please, let us not make this Thanksgiving the deadliest day of this pandemic.”

The pandemic continues to threaten many of California’s 5 million small businesses. For a time, loans and grants from Congress’ $2.2-trillion CARES Act helped some of them weather the collapse in their customer bases and supply chains. Now those funds have dried up — and many are wondering if they can survive a longer downturn without some federal assistance.

Take Cynde and John Harris, who operate Go Kart World in Carson along an industrial strip by the 405 Freeway. After customers fled and health officials shut down the business, the couple furloughed 35 workers. Over the next few months, they managed to get two federal loans for a total of $270,000. A $30,000 grant from Los Angeles County came through in October, and Go Kart World reopened this month.

Harris is still worried, though. “You can only take on so much debt,” she said. “It’s bitter medicine to be told, ‘You can borrow the money,’ when a government closure just drove a truck through your business.”

Without new federal aid, tens of thousands of California small businesses may find themselves back on the brink.

“The loans they got gave many businesses some moments of respite,” said John Kabateck, California director of the National Federation of Independent Business. “But they were Band-Aids on a very big wound. Now they’re very, very terrified.”

Los Angeles County’s ban on outdoor dining is being met with some resistance from the California Restaurant Assn., which filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court to block it from going into effect. But a judge declined to do so Tuesday, which means that restaurants must shut down their open-air operations Wednesday night.

Jot Condie, the restaurant group’s CEO, expressed disappointment that the judge didn’t “pump the brakes” on the closure but said he was glad the suit could move forward.

“We are pleased that the court recognized our right to put the county to the test to prove that they have a scientific basis for the shutdown of outdoor dining, and we plan to move forward in requiring the county to offer that proof,” Condie said.

The outdoor closure order, which applies to restaurants, breweries, wineries and bars for at least three weeks, was announced Sunday as part of a larger effort to get surging coronavirus cases under control.

The restaurant association isn’t the only source of pushback. The city of Pasadena said Monday that it will let restaurants continue outdoor dining despite the county order. The city has its own public health department that can issue independent orders, but has generally followed L.A. County’s lead. (Long Beach’s public health department sided with L.A. County and issued a similar health order.)

Around the nation and the world

If you’re like me, you’re waiting with bated breath for the arrival of the first COVID-19 vaccines, the first of which could be arriving in a matter of weeks. But let that breath out — safely, behind a mask — because it’s still going to be a long while before you can hit up a concert, laugh with friends in a crowded restaurant or hug your grandparents.

The first vaccine shipments in the United States will be just the beginning of what could be a long and turbulent ride to herd immunity and the return of something resembling normal life.

“If you’re fighting a battle and the cavalry is on the way, you don’t stop shooting; you keep going until the cavalry gets here, and then you might even want to continue fighting,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert.

First off, most folks won’t get those early vaccine supplies. They’ll likely be reserved for first responders and the most vulnerable among us, such as the elderly. Second, the front-running vaccines must be taken in two doses administered a month apart — which means we’ll probably be well into late January before even the earliest birds are fully protected.

Getting to herd immunity will take even longer. Early data on the efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna shots suggest that about 70% of the population will need to be vaccinated to reach that milestone, and that will likely happen in May, according to Moncef Slaoui, head of the U.S. vaccine development effort.

The federal prison system will be among the first government agencies to get the COVID-19 vaccine — with a caveat. Those first precious doses will be given to staff and not to inmates, even though infected prisoners far outnumber infected staff. Since the pandemic first arrived on U.S. shores, 18,467 inmates and 1,736 staff have recovered from COVID-19, and 141 inmates and two staff members have died.

Prisons are a dangerously easy environment for the coronavirus to spread; with inmates sleeping close together and sharing bathrooms, social distancing is essentially nonexistent behind bars. In the pandemic’s early days, prisoners and staffers said the Bureau of Prisons had run short of even basic supplies such as soap.

Now the situation appears to be getting worse. Nearly 25% of all inmate cases and 30% of staff cases have been reported just in the last month.

“If true, it’s a disgrace,” David Patton, the head of the federal defender office in New York, said of the plan to vaccinate staffers but not inmates. “Prisoners are among the very highest-risk groups for contracting COVID-19. ... The government should certainly prioritize prison staff, but to not also prioritize the people incarcerated is irresponsible and inhumane.”

Across the pond in Britain, authorities Tuesday gave residents a green light to gather for the holidays, relaxing restrictions on social mixing over Christmas. They also offered inbound international travelers a way to cut quarantine short if they test negative for COVID-19.

Between Dec. 23 and 27, members of up to three households can form a “Christmas bubble” and move freely between them. Under current restrictions, people are barred from visiting members of other households in much of the U.K.

Cabinet minister Michael Gove said the agreement “will offer hope for families and friends who have made many sacrifices over this difficult year.”

But while government scientific advisers have signed off on the restriction-relaxing plan, others have warned that the policy will probably lead to a rise in coronavirus infections around the country.

The U.K. logged 11,299 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, marking the lowest level since early October.



Your questions answered

Today’s question comes from a reader who wants to know: If your toes turn red but you have no other symptoms, could you have the coronavirus?

This reader appears to be referring to what’s come to be known as “COVID toes,” a condition that causes a person infected with the coronavirus to develop discolored and swollen toes. According to the American Academy of Dermatology Assn., COVID toes most commonly seem to develop in children, teens and young adults, though they can appear at any age.

Many of these patients never develop more common symptoms of COVID-19, such as a dry cough, fever and muscle aches. And when they do have symptoms of COVID-19, the symptoms tend to be mild.

“In general, individuals who get COVID toes are otherwise healthy,” said Dr. Amy Paller, director of the Skin Disease Research Center at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “A subset have — or more often have had in the previous month — some other types of symptoms that can be seen in viral disorders.”

So yes, it‘s possible that COVID toes are your only sign of a coronavirus infection. But plenty of people with red, swollen toes also test negative for infection, Paller said. More work needs to be done to suss out the link between the virus and this phenomenon.

# Doctors urge the CDC to warn Americans about coronavirus vaccine side effects

U.S. doctors are worried that their patients won't return to get a second dose of coronavirus vaccine if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) doesn't give them a clear, upfront warning that none of the shots will be a 'walk in the park.'

'As a practicing physician, I have got to be sure my patients will come back for the second dose,' said Dr Sandra Fryhofer of Emory University during a Monday meeting with officials, attended by CNBC.

'We really have got to make patients aware that this is not going to be a walk in the park.'

Participants in trials for vaccines made by Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna have described the side effects of the shots as similar to the symptoms of COVID-19 itself.

On the other hand, convincing Americans - especially some who are high-risk, including black and Latinx people in the U.S. - that COVID-19 vaccines are safe to take has been a challenge to begin with.

Ultimately, it will be up to states to decide how to distribute vaccines to their populations, and who will get them first, HHS Secretary Alex Azar announced Tuesday - and that will include how to talk to their residents about vaccination.

CDC and state officials as well as individual doctors will have to walk a thin line between telling hundreds of millions of Americans what to expect from a coronavirus vaccine and avoiding scaring them off from getting the shots.

Doctors advising the CDC on how to distribute coronavirus vaccines urged official to warn Americans that the shots could leave them with side effects like fatigue, aches and fevers - not unlike the virus itself - while convincing people to get both doses of the shots (file)

Overall, trials for all three shots deemed them safe and 'tolerable,' meaning the risks of their side effects were clearly outweighed by the shots' benefits.

But 'tolerable' does not mean that the shots have no effects.

Like most vaccines, the three COVID-19 jabs come with some soreness and aches at the injection sites and throughout the body.

According to participants in each trial, however, the coronavirus vaccines pack more of a punch than most.

Coronavirus vaccines might leave us laid up for a day with headaches, fevers, sore muscles, shivering chills and no energy, participants in trials for Moderna's and Pfizer's shots told CNBC.

But the side effects will be worth it, and fade after a day, they added.

Vaccines of all kinds commonly come with side effects - some more unpleasant than others.

Luke Hutchinson, 44, volunteered to participate in Moderna's coronavirus vaccine trial. After his second dose of the shot, he developed a fever, aches that left him bedridden for the day and with chills so bad he cracked a tooth while shaking. He told CNBC he wishes he'd had warning, but thinks the shot's protection is worth the discomfort.

His first shot left Hutchinson with just mild side effects, but he compared his symptoms to 'full-on COVID' after the second shot

Luke Hutchinsons, 44, was prepared for that possibility after signing up to help test whether Moderna's shot worked, safely.

He felt a bit less than 100 percent for a few days after the first dose but eight hours after his second dose on September 15, the healthy computational biologist was too weak to leave bed, running a high fever and writhing with pain and shivers.

It even got harder for Hutchinson to breathe. The experimental COVID-19 vaccine left him feeling like he'd contracted the virus it was meant to protect him against.

He wasn't the only one. CNBC spoke to two other participants in the Moderna trial and two enrolled in Pfizer's vaccine trial, all of whom reported intense - but thankfully brief - side effects.

In addition to their side effects, the vaccine testers share the opinion that most people should still get a COVID-19 vaccine, once one has been approved.

Their advice to the vaccine makers echoed that of the doctors on the Monday call: warn people what they are in for after getting their shots.

Vaccines work by tricking the body into thinking it's been infected with the pathogens the shot is designed to protect against.

By doing so, the shot trains the immune system what to look for, so that it's primed and ready to fight off the real danger when we encounter it.

Sarah Hurst, 47, from Goring-on-Thames and Jack Somers, 35, took part in the trials. Ms Hurst said it gave her a 'tiny sense of pride' to have been a volunteer in the trials

But some of the symptoms we experience when we catch a virus, like a cold, or the flu or coronavirus itself are due to that immune response.

This crossover between what it feels like to have a virus and to get a shot that ramps up your immune response as if you have a virus has caused confusion, including the incorrect belief of many who are vaccine hesitant that vaccines, like those against measles or the flu actually 'give' the recipient the respective viruses.

Still others who are vaccine hesitant realize that what they experience after a shot is a reaction, but would rather take the risk of possibly contracting a virus than sign up to knowingly sign up for a known possible 'adverse event.'

Importantly, not all COVID-19 recipients experience these effects.

Nevertheless, how clinicians giving vaccines prepare the recipients to get their shots, which come in two doses, will be crucial, the experts on Monday's call said.

Patsy Stinchfield, a nurse practitioner at Children's Minnesota made the point that the language clinicians use to talk about the shots could make a difference.

She suggested explaining potential aches, pains, fevers and chills as a 'response' to the vaccine, rather than an 'adverse reaction,' according to CNBC.

'These are immune responses, and so if you feel something after vaccination, you should expect to feel that.

'When you do, it's normal to have some arm soreness or fatigue, some body aches and maybe even a fever. It sounds like in some of these trials, maybe even having to stay home from work.'

That was the case for one North Carolina woman who took part in Moderna's trial.

'The first dose is no big deal. And then the second dose will definitely put you down for the day for sure...You will need to take a day off after the second dose,' the woman in her 50s told CNBC this summer.

'If this proves to work, people are going to have to toughen up,' another Moderna trial participant said.

Participants in Pfizer's trial in Australia also claimed they suffered migraines and fevers.

Jack Sommers, a 35-year-old journalist who took part in Oxford's trial in the UK described having a low-grade fever and an achy arm after vaccination, but told Daily Mail Online he was very happy to have participated and felt like a member of a winning team after hearing that the shot he'd helped test worked.";"(2019-12-13)

CDC Issued A Warning-Don’t Have a Flu Shot This Year – VIBRATIONS OF HEALTH http://t.co/8LXeaJzwEr
  — Danette Steele (@DanetteSteele) October 19, 2015
  
Origins: On 16 October 2015, an unreliable but popular alternative health web site published an article titled “CDC Issued A Warning—Don’t Have a Flu Shot This Year,” which maintained:
The flu vaccine can be deadly. CDC issued this warning —This year the flu vaccine won’t work. This admission followed a much stronger warning out of Italy following a full investigation when more than a dozen people died 48 hours after receiving the the flu vaccine.
Thousands of users shared the article in just a few days, presumably based entirely on the click-baiting headline. It wasn’t until readers worked through to the second page of the post that they saw the blog on which it was hosted had noted that the rumor was neither new nor specific to 2015; it was simply a variation on an earlier claim falsely stating the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had “apologized” for an ineffective flu shot the previous year:
This was published 10 months ago. Do you think that the flu vaccine is safer now?
It’s possible that the original rumor (claiming the CDC apologized for an ineffective flu shot) was revived following a 14 October 2015 Facebook post published by a separate, unreliable alternative health site. However, had the CDC issued any alerts, warnings, guidelines, or other information, they would likely appear on the agency’s official flu shot Twitter stream (@CDCFlu). That account advised Twitter users to get a flu vaccine annually, never said this year’s vaccines were ineffective, and never recommended avoiding it:

The article also provides context about the origins of this rumor and references the CDC's official stance encouraging annual flu vaccinations.;2199;120

# Men with 'the Celtic gene' are 11 times more likely to develop liver cancer, study finds

Men who have at least two copies of 'the Celtic gene' are 11 times more likely to be diagnosed with liver cancer, a study has found.

The gene, which is a mutation on the p.C282Y gene, is so nicknamed because it's found most commonly in people with Celtic British heritage.

It causes a condition called haemochromatosis, which is an unhealthy build-up of iron in the blood, which scientists say increases the risk of liver cancer.

More than seven per cent of men who had the faulty gene developed the life-threatening condition by the age of 75 in a study, while the rate in the general population was just 0.6 per cent.

Scientists said up to 175,000 men and boys in Britain have inherited the genes from their European ancestors.

Women carry the gene as well but the study found they did not face an increased cancer risk in the study, and they also suffer less from haemochromatosis.

Warning signs that someone has the Celtic gene include tiredness, muscle weakness and joint pain, and it can be diagnosed through a quick blood test.

People who carry it are told to drink less alcohol than the Government's 14 units a week limit to limit liver damage, and to get their blood treated regularly to remove excess concentrations of the element.

This graph from the study paper shows how common liver cancer was in people with two copies of the Celtic gene, broken down by age (blue line), and how common it was in those without the gene (yellow line)

Scientists from the University of Exeter analysed information about 1,294 men with at least one Celtic gene from England, Scotland and Wales, using data stored in the UK Biobank.

Twenty-one of these men developed liver cancer over the nine-year period examined, and 14 of them died from the disease.

WHAT IS HAEMO-CHROMATOSIS? Haemochromatosis is an inherited condition in which iron levels in the body slowly build up over many years. This build-up of iron, known as iron overload, can cause unpleasant symptoms. If it isn't treated, this can damage parts of the body such as the liver, joints, pancreas and heart. Haemochromatosis most often affects people of white northern European background and is particularly common in countries where lots of people have a Celtic background, such as Ireland, Scotland and Wales, hence its nickname of the 'Celtic curse'. The genetic mutation that causes the condition is carried by 250,000 people in the UK and around 1million in the US. Symptoms include fatigue, weight loss and joint pain. However, the condition can also cause erectile dysfunction in men and irregular periods in women. Although haemochromatosis itself will not kill someone or make them seriously ill, if it's not treated the excess build-up of iron can lead to more dangerous complications such as permanent liver damage or cancer, diabetes, arthritis or heart failure. Source: NHS Choices Advertisement

The figures were adjusted to project the risk of developing the disease among those who had at least two copies of the gene to give the 7.2 per cent figure.

The scientists also followed 1,596 women with the genes, but found the genes did not significantly impact their risk of developing liver cancer.

The scientists said this may be because women lose iron when they menstruate and during childbirth, therefore it is less likely to build to harmful levels in their bodies, although some do still develop haemochromatosis.

The work was published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA.

Professor David Melzer, a public health expert who led the research, said: 'Tragically, men with haemochromatosis faulty gene have been dying of liver cancer for many years, but this was thought to be rare.

'The large scale of the UK Biobank study allowed us to measure cancer risk accurately.

'We were shocked to find that more than seven per cent of men with two faulty genes are likely to develop liver cancer by age 75, particularly considering that the UK has the second highest rate of these faulty genes in the world.'

He added: 'Fortunately most of these cancers could be prevented with early treatment. Blood donations made during routine treatment of haemochromatosis can be used for other patients, so early diagnosis would actually be a win-win for the NHS.'

Excess iron is stored by liver when it cannot be used by the body and the chemical – which is a heavy metal – is known to be toxic in high concentrations.

It has been seen to directly damage DNA, which can lead to mutations or cell death, and may also block tumour-suppressing genes which help to weed out early genetic errors that can develop into cancers.

The scientists said their results suggested diagnostic tests should be carried out earlier to detect those who have the faulty genes.

Above is a scan showing the liver and a cancerous growth inside it. This was taken from Cassidy Armstrong, 36, from the US, who thought she was facing a 'death sentence' when the watermelon-sized tumour was identified

WHAT IS LIVER CANCER? Figures show almost 6,000 Britons and 33,000 Americans are diagnosed with liver cancer every year. The killer disease is often difficult to treat because it can be hard to spot at an early stage, when it causes few noticeable symptoms. Many patients miss out on life-saving surgery because they aren't diagnosed with the disease until it has already spread. Instead, they receive chemotherapy and other similar treatments to slow down its progression. Five-year survival rates are as low as six per cent. Common symptoms are jaundice, loss of appetite, unintentional weight loss, bouts of vomiting, itchy skin and fatigue, the NHS says. Half of cases are considered preventable. Drinking too much alcohol, being overweight and smoking are all linked to the disease. Advertisement

Dr Janice Atkins, research fellow at the University of Exeter and first author of the paper, warned the faulty genes are 'relatively common' in people with European ancestry.

'Unfortunately, haemochromatosis is often diagnosed too late,' she said. 'Earlier diagnosis could prevent so much unnecessary disease.'

A study published in the British Medical Journal last year warned that the faulty genes quadruple the risk of someone developing liver disease.

The researchers found that in men, who are at twice the risk of women, 1.6 per cent of all hip replacements and 5.8 per cent of all liver cancers were down to haemochromatosis.

Liver cancer sometimes doesn't cause symptoms until it is in the late stages and difficult to treat, meaning it is difficult to diagnose early on.

It was revealed last year that deaths from the illness had surged by 50 per cent in ten years, and were rising faster than those from any other type of disease.

There were 5,700 deaths from the cancer in 2017, according to Cancer Research UK, a marked surge from the 3,200 deaths caused by the condition ten years ago.

Cancer Research UK's liver cancer expert, Professor Helen Reeves at Newcastle University, said at the time: 'Unfortunately, progress in treating liver cancer has been painfully slow and we desperately need more options for patients.

'Another problem is the rise in the number of people being diagnosed, which has meant we are losing more people to this disease than ever before.

'Rising levels of obesity and associated conditions like diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have likely had a big role in this, although they aren't the only factors.'";"(2019-12-13)

# Biopharma industry works to build confidence in Covid-19 vaccines

Laboratory technicians in Anagni, Italy, handle capped vials as part of filling and packaging tests for the large-scale production and supply of AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford's Covid-19 vaccine candidate.

Over the last few weeks, the United States has surpassed 100,000 Covid-19 cases a day and reached the staggering milestone of 10 million cases. This is both sobering and humbling.

While there has been encouraging news about progress in the development of Covid-19 vaccines, making sure that Americans have confidence in these vaccines is crucial to helping bend the curve of infections and getting us back to some semblance of normalcy.

According to researchers writing in The Lancet, we will need a majority of Americans to have the confidence to get vaccinated for Covid-19 vaccines to be effective in moving the U.S. toward population-level control of viral spread. As Anthony Fauci has noted, “If you have a vaccine that is highly effective and not enough people get vaccinated, you’re not going to realize the full, important effect of having a vaccine.”

Widely reported public opinion polls have suggested that a sizable portion of the public is in a wait-and-see mode for getting vaccinated against Covid-19. My colleagues and I in the biopharmaceutical industry, an industry built on science, recognize that one of our duties in the Covid-19 pandemic is to lift the veil on the processes that companies are using to research and develop Covid-19 vaccines. This includes testing every potential vaccine candidate among tens of thousands of people from all walks of life before they are sent to the Food and Drug Administration for regulatory review.

Information and transparency help reduce uncertainty and vaccine hesitancy. Here are three things the biopharmaceutical industry is doing to ensure the safety and integrity of Covid-19 vaccine development.

advertisement

Meeting the highest standards

Covid-19 vaccine candidates must meet the same standards for clinical trials as other vaccines, including testing in very large Phase 3 clinical trials. We would have it no other way.

Vaccine candidates from Pfizer and Moderna have enrolled more than 40,000 and 30,000 participants, respectively, and AstraZeneca expects to enroll up to 60,000 participants globally in trials of its vaccine in development. Today, more than 30 unique vaccines are in clinical trials, with several of them already in Phase 3 trials with promising results. What’s more, many of the vaccine candidates are currently being manufactured in large numbers and at financial risk to the companies developing them — before they have been submitted to the FDA for review — so if they are given the green light they will be ready to ship as quickly as possible.

Researchers are closely monitoring data, including any reports of adverse events, throughout the clinical trial process to understand the safety profile of each vaccine. For any vaccine candidates found to be safe and effective that receive either approval or emergency use authorization from the FDA, the biopharmaceutical companies developing them will continue to take steps to help ensure product safety, including manufacturing controls that help ensure quality and ongoing surveillance and assessment of adverse events.

Because vaccines are given to healthy individuals, industry sponsors must be confident in the safety and effectiveness of any new vaccine based on data from large, rigorous clinical trials conducted among diverse populations before submitting their data to FDA and other national regulatory agencies around the globe for review.

Providing transparency

The biopharmaceutical industry has been working at a furious pace to provide as much timely, accurate, and transparent data as possible. Companies have taken unprecedented steps to share vaccine clinical trial protocols and trial recruiting updates in as close to real time as possible. They are sharing data with each other, as well as with public institutions and academia. And information on clinical trials being conducted in the U.S. is also readily available to the public on ClinicalTrials.gov.

The industry supports efforts by the FDA to provide clarifying guidance, including recent guidelines about the standards for emergency use authorization of Covid-19 vaccines.

The FDA’s efforts to instill confidence in the safety of these potential vaccines has been noteworthy. It recently took steps to ensure a robust review process for candidate vaccines by engaging the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This body provides independent review and guidance to support the FDA’s role in regulating vaccines for Americans. Its first public meeting was broadcast on YouTube for the world to see. The FDA has said that additional VRBPAC meetings will be held to provide input and guidance for FDA review of anticipated Covid-19 vaccine applications.

The industry I represent is committed to ensuring that the highest of standards of research, clinical testing, and manufacturing are upheld throughout the vaccine research and development process. To put this in context and to help instill greater confidence in these candidate vaccines, the leading biopharmaceutical companies working on vaccines for Covid-19 issued a pledge “to make the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals the top priority in development of the first Covid-19 vaccines.” This commitment to safety isn’t new — it’s what the industry does day in and day out.

Advancing diversity

The industry is also working to address the systemic challenges and skepticism that have traditionally kept people of color from participating in clinical trials because of historic wrongs done to them.

Clinical trials can give people access to potentially lifesaving medicines and high-quality care. Improving the diversity of people participating in clinical trials will lead to evidence that better reflects the patients who will use approved vaccines.

To start, the industry is working with the FDA, patient advocacy organizations, medical providers, and other stakeholders across the research ecosystem to collaborate and employ strategies to encourage greater participation in all clinical trials, with a focus on Covid-19 trials. PhRMA, the organization I lead, recently released the first-ever industry-wide principles on clinical trial diversity, which represent an important step toward greater health equity.

These efforts are working. The clinical trial for Moderna’s vaccine trial “includes more than 11,000 participants from communities of color, representing 37% of the study population, which is similar to the diversity of the U.S. at large.” Pfizer also expanded its clinical trial from an initial population of 30,000 to more than 40,000 to increase the diversity of participants.

Looking to the future

Biopharmaceutical companies are working tirelessly to identify and develop safe and effective vaccines to prevent Covid-19 and researching and developing new therapies to treat those with the disease. Given the urgent need to address the pandemic, along with the complexity of the human immune system and how it responds to this disease, a wide range of approaches are being tested in an effort to improve the odds that one or more vaccine and drug candidates will be successful.

At the same time, companies are continuing their work on treatments for heart disease and cancer and so many other diseases.

In fighting Covid-19, putting safety first, being open and transparent, and working to ensure diverse representation in clinical trials is a model for the future of biopharmaceutical innovation that I hope all companies continue to embrace.

We aren’t out of the woods yet, but I’m confident science can get us back to normal.

# How Do I Reduce My Belly Fat Quickly?

How Do I Reduce My Belly Fat?

Unfortunately, there is no way to quickly reduce belly fat. While fad diets may help you drop pounds quickly and possibly even trim inches off your waistline, most of that will likely be water weight and not belly fat and it will be temporary. Losing belly fat comes down to old fashioned diet and exercise, which are key factors in determining how much fat is in our bodies.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) suggests:

Limiting total fat intake to 20 to 30 percent of total calories

Keeping saturated fat intake to less than 7 percent

Limiting trans fats

Additional diet tips to help reduce belly fat include:

Reducing sugar intake The body needs very little sugar and any excess is stored as fat Cut down on sugars in empty carbohydrates such as cookies, cake, and white bread

Consume a plant-based diet Beans, lentils, peas and chickpeas (called pulses) are high in fiber and plant protein and help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce overall body fat People who consume whole grains lose more belly fat than those who eat processed grains

Intermittent fasting Based on the concept that humans were designed to eat for short periods of time followed by hours (and sometimes days) of fasting There are no food or caloric restrictions, but restrictions on WHEN to eat Popular methods include 16/8 (8 hours of eating followed by 16 hours of fasting), the “Eat-Stop-Eat” method (two 24-hour fasts per week on non-consecutive days); and the 5/2 method (only 500 calories for 2 non-consecutive days, and 5 days of normal eating per week) Intermittent fasting has been shown to help reduce belly fat



Exercise also plays a role in losing body fat and diet plus exercise works best to reduce belly fat. A study in the Journal of Applied Physiology found people who exercised regularly were able to prevent belly fat gain, or lose belly fat, compared to those who didn’t exercise. The study found that just 30 minutes of walking, 6 days per week was enough to prevent accumulation of belly fat. Exercising longer, rather than harder, worked best to lose more belly fat.

The best exercise regimen for fat loss includes both aerobic and strength exercises (resistance training). High-intensity interval training (HIIT), also called high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE), is a type of cardiovascular exercise that alternates between short bouts of high-intensity and low-intensity exercise. HIIT usually alternates between slower to moderate-intensity and high-intensity movements. The Obesity Reviews Journal reviewed 13 different studies on overweight adults and found that HIIT reduced weight and waist circumference.";"(2019-12-13)

# Pfizer demands “emergency” authorization from FDA for experimental Covid-19 vaccine

(Natural News)
 After declaring its own experimental Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine to be “safe,” “effective,” and ready to go, drug giant Pfizer is now planning to file for emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
In a press release, Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech indicated plans to immediately petition the FDA for fast-tracked approval of its BNT162b2 jab which, if granted, would “potentially enable use of the vaccine in high-risk populations in the U.S. by the middle to end of December 2020.”
With an alleged 95 percent effectiveness rate and “no serious safety concerns,” according to Pfizer, BNT162b2 could be rolled out on a mass scale in a matter of weeks. This would mean that tens of thousands of Americans would get vaccinated just in time for Christmas.
“Filing in the U.S. represents a critical milestone in our journey to deliver a Covid-19 vaccine to the world and we now have a more complete picture of both the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine,” announced Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla in a statement.

“Over the last two weeks, we’ve seen just unprecedented historic news about vaccines, two vaccines, each with 95 percent efficacy, rivaling the 98 percent efficacy of our measles vaccine,” announced Trump’s White House Coronavirus Task Force head Alex Azar.
Moderna’s vaccine is actually only 90 percent effective, supposedly, but who really cares about data accuracy when we have emergency vaccines to get approved at warp speed?
Meanwhile, Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) could not be more thrilled at the news. Fauci insists that this warp speed endeavor did not cut any corners, and that the vaccines will all be perfectly safe and effective, for sure.
“The process of the speed did not compromise at all safety, nor did it compromise scientific integrity,” the elf-like authority declared.
“It was a reflection of the extraordinary scientific advances in these types of vaccines, which allowed us to do things in months that actually took years before.”
Fauci says Big Pharma’s vaccine rush is an “independent” endeavor
Fauci, who is financially invested in the novel antiviral drug remdesivir, further claimed that Operation Warp Speed and the push to manufacture and release Covid-19 vaccines as fast as possible has nothing to do with catering to special interests.
Fauci insists that the program is made up of an “independent body of people who have no allegiance to anyone, not to the administration, not to me, not to the companies, that looked at the data and deemed it to be sound.”
Frustrated that millions of Americans are asking questions about what quite clearly is a sham endeavor, Fauci snapped that people need to “put to rest any concept that this was rushed in an inappropriate way” because the science, he claims, “is really solid.”

# Do you have high cholesterol or triglycerides? Check your vitamin D levels

(Natural News)
 Cholesterol levels are an important marker of cardiovascular health. While your body needs cholesterol to build healthy cells, high levels of it can increase your risk of heart disease. Cholesterol is a fatty substance. If it accumulates in your blood vessels, it can restrict blood flow and form blood clots, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.
Your total cholesterol levels consist of the amount of triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in your blood. Triglycerides and LDL cholesterol can accumulate in your body and clog your blood vessels. Meanwhile, HDL cholesterol helps protect you from heart disease.
One factor that may affect cholesterol levels is vitamin D deficiency. In a study published in the journal Nutrition Reviews, study author Daniel Dibaba of the University of Kentucky and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center found that people with vitamin D deficiency improved their cholesterol levels upon taking vitamin D supplements.
Vitamin D improves cholesterol levels

Previous studies have linked vitamin?D deficiency to heart attacks, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, stroke and other conditions associated with cardiovascular disease, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Other studies have also suggested that vitamin?D may have a beneficial effect on one’s cholesterol profile and cardiovascular health.
To evaluate these findings, Dibaba analyzed 41 randomized controlled trials that examined the effect of vitamin?D supplementation on cholesterol levels. The studies involved more than 3,400 participants, half of whom took vitamin D supplements while the remaining half took a placebo. A quarter of the trials had follow-up periods of over six months.
Dibaba found that the volunteers who took vitamin D supplements significantly reduced their total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and maintained healthy HDL cholesterol levels. These improvements, according to the Dibaba, were more pronounced in the participants with vitamin D deficiency. (Related: Magnesium and vitamin D: The perfect pair?)
 “Vitamin?D supplementation may be useful in hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) patients with vitamin?D insufficiency who are at high risk of cardiovascular diseases,” wrote Dibaba.

Prevent vitamin D deficiency
Vitamin D deficiency is an important health issue in the U.S. Around 56 percent of Caucasian infants and 35 percent of American adults have vitamin D deficiency.
Your body produces vitamin D when you’re exposed to sunlight. But the increased use of sunscreen and spending less time outdoors can affect how much vitamin D is produced by your body.
Other factors that lead to lower vitamin D levels include: (h/t to HopkinsMedicine.org)

Obesity and being overweight – Fat cells absorb vitamin D and keep it from circulating throughout the bloodstream.
Dark skin – People with dark skin have a built-in natural sunscreen in melanin, which prevents the skin from synthesizing vitamin D.
Sex – Women tend to have lower vitamin D levels than men. That’s because women have more body fat and often spend more time indoors. Women also tend to wear hats and sunscreen more often than men.
Age – As you get older, your body absorbs less vitamin D from your diet and produces less vitamin D in the skin.
Location – Areas farther away from the equator don’t receive enough sunlight from November to February.

Take vitamin D supplements and eat more foods rich in vitamin D to prevent vitamin D deficiency. These foods include fatty fish, fortified orange juice, egg yolk, liver, cereal and milk. If you’re taking supplements, the recommended daily amount of vitamin D is 400 international units (IU) for children up to 12 months of age, 600 IU for ages 1 to 70 years and 800 IU for adults over 70 years.

# Pfizer demands “emergency” authorization from FDA for experimental Covid-19 vaccine

(Natural News)
 After declaring its own experimental Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine to be “safe,” “effective,” and ready to go, drug giant Pfizer is now planning to file for emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
In a press release, Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech indicated plans to immediately petition the FDA for fast-tracked approval of its BNT162b2 jab which, if granted, would “potentially enable use of the vaccine in high-risk populations in the U.S. by the middle to end of December 2020.”

# Lower your cholesterol naturally with these nutrients

(Natural News)
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in three Americans suffers from high blood cholesterol, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke.
Eating plenty of fatty foods and red meat is the usual cause of high cholesterol. However, this health condition does not present symptoms. For this reason, stroke or heart attack often seems sudden when either occurs.
Fortunately, you can easily reverse high cholesterol and minimize your CVD risk by increasing your consumption of certain dietary nutrients. Here are six nutrients that are known to help lower cholesterol levels: (Related: How naturopathy helps with controlling cholesterol.)
Niacin
Niacin, or vitamin B3, helps raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. HDL, commonly referred to as the “good” cholesterol, helps remove low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from the bloodstream. LDL, or “bad” cholesterol, can form plaques along the walls of the arteries and clog them, raising the risk CVD and stroke.
Niacin is abundant in the following foods:

Chicken liver
Chicken breast
Grass-fed beef
Peanuts
Avocado
Brown rice
Whole wheat
Mushrooms
Green peas
Potatoes
Fatty fish (tuna, salmon and anchovies)

Monacolin K
Red yeast rice contains monacolin K, a plant compound said to be identical to the active component of the cholesterol-lowering drug, lovastatin. Red yeast rice can be taken as a supplement to help reduce blood cholesterol levels and improve heart health.
Phytosterols
Phytosterols, or plant sterols, are compounds found in the cell membranes of plants. They have a similar structure to human cholesterol and can help reduce LDL and overall cholesterol levels when ingested. These plant-based foods provide high amounts of phytosterols:

Nuts
Flaxseeds
Broccoli
Red onion
Carrot
Brussels sprouts
Spinach
Berries
Banana
Lettuce

Soluble fiber
During digestion, soluble fiber from the foods you eat dissolves in water and is broken down into a gel-like substance in the colon. This gel-like substance slows digestion and traps LDL cholesterol, preventing it from entering the bloodstream and traveling to various parts of the body.
According to recent studies, consuming five to 10 grams of soluble fiber every day can reduce cholesterol by five percent.
The following foods contain significant amounts of soluble fiber:

Brussels sprouts
Sweet potatoes
Avocados
Turnips
Pears
Figs
Oats
Beans
Apples
Barley
Guavas
Carrots
Flaxseeds
Hazelnuts
Sunflower seeds

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)
CoQ10 is a nutrient naturally produced by the body and used for the production of cellular energy. It is hailed for its antioxidant properties and its ability to significantly reduce cholesterol levels.
Some studies suggest that taking CoQ10 supplements can help reduce the adverse side effects of statins, a class of lipid-lowering drugs. Such side effects include weakness, muscle aches and joint pains.
CoQ10 can be found in several foods, such as:

Organ meats (heart, liver and kidney)
Grass-fed beef
Chicken
Cauliflower
Strawberries
Sesame seeds
Pistachios
Lentils
Oranges
Fatty fish (trout, herring and mackerel)

Ginger compounds
A study published in The Journal of Nutrition revealed that ginger extract significantly reduces LDL cholesterol and helps prevent the development of atherosclerotic lesions.
In a more recent study, researchers from the Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran also found that ginger helps reduce total cholesterol levels and improves the lipid profile of diabetic patients.
Eating more of the right nutrients as part of a balanced diet helps naturally reduce cholesterol levels and keep both CVD and stroke at bay.

# Anxiety Associated With Faster Alzheimer’s Disease Onset

Summary: Anxiety may accelerate the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. Brain scans revealed patients who progressed from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease had decreased volume in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

Source: RSNA

Anxiety is associated with an increased rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study being presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Alzheimer’s disease represents a major public health crisis worldwide. The number of deaths from the disease has more than doubled since 2000, and it is currently the fifth-leading cause of death among individuals over 65 in the U.S.

Many people with Alzheimer’s disease first suffer from mild cognitive impairment, a decline in cognitive abilities like memory and thinking skills that is more rapid than normally associated with aging. Anxiety has been frequently observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment, although its role in disease progression is not well understood.

“We know that volume loss in certain areas of the brain is a factor that predicts progression to Alzheimer’s disease,” said study senior author Maria Vittoria Spampinato, M.D., professor of radiology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston. “In this study, we wanted to see if anxiety had an effect on brain structure, or if the effect of anxiety was independent from brain structure in favoring the progression of disease.”

The study group included 339 patients, average age of 72 years, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 cohort. Each person had a baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment; 72 progressed to Alzheimer’s disease while 267 remained stable.

The researchers obtained brain MRIs to determine the baseline volumes of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, two areas important to forming memories. They also tested for the presence of the ApoE4 allele, the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Anxiety was measured with established clinical surveys.

As expected, patients who progressed to Alzheimer’s disease had significantly lower volumes in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex and greater frequency of the ApoE4 allele. Most notably though, the researchers found that anxiety was independently associated with cognitive decline.

“Mild cognitive impairment patients with anxiety symptoms developed Alzheimer’s disease faster than individuals without anxiety, independently of whether they had a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease or brain volume loss,” said study first author Jenny L. Ulber, a medical student at MUSC.

The link between anxiety symptoms and a faster progression to Alzheimer’s disease presents an opportunity for improving the screening and management of patients with early mild cognitive impairment, the researchers said.

“We need to better understand the association between anxiety disorders and cognitive decline,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We don’t know yet if the anxiety is a symptom–in other words, their memory is getting worse and they become anxious–or if anxiety contributes to cognitive decline. If we were able in the future to find that anxiety is actually causing progression, then we should more aggressively screen for anxiety disorders in the elderly.”

“The geriatric population is routinely screened for depression in many hospitals, but perhaps this vulnerable population should also be assessed for anxiety disorders,” Ulber added. “Middle-aged and elderly individuals with high level of anxiety may benefit from intervention, whether it be pharmacological or cognitive behavioral therapy, with the goal of slowing cognitive decline.”

The study was based on MRI scans done at one point in time. For future research, the team would like to study MRIs obtained after the initial scan to better understand the connection between anxiety and brain structure.

“We’re now interested in looking at changes over time to see if anxiety has an effect one way or the other on how fast the brain damage progresses,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We will also take a closer look at gender differences in the association between anxiety and cognitive decline.”

# Common Weight-Loss Surgery Can Weaken a Teen's Bones

Sleeve gastrectomy, a procedure used to help obese people lose weight, may damage the bones of teen patients, a new study finds.

""Childhood obesity is a major public health issue that has increased over the last 10 years,"" said researcher Dr. Miriam Bredella, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School. ""Sleeve gastrectomy is the most common bariatric surgery procedure performed in children and adults.""

In the procedure, about 75% of the stomach is removed to reduce how much someone can eat.

""In adults, bariatric surgery can have long-term effects on bone, leading to higher fracture risk,"" Bredella noted, saying the researchers wanted to focus on teens ""during the crucial years when bone mass is being accrued.""

For the study, researchers examined 52 obese teens, 26 of whom had a sleeve gastrectomy.

Before and a year after surgery, patients had a CT scan of the lumbar spine, to measure the amount of bone mineral density. Patients also had a proton MR spectroscopy to look at bone marrow fat.

Patients who had the procedure lost a significant amount of weight, but also had a significant increase in bone marrow fat and a decrease in bone density in the lumbar spine, the researchers found.

""Adolescents who underwent sleeve gastrectomy had bone loss and an increase in bone marrow fat, despite marked loss of body fat,"" Bredella said. ""While weight-loss surgery is successful for weight loss and improving metabolic disorders, it has negative effects on bone.""

Loss of bone density was expected, she said. Other effects of the surgery include disruption of hormones and nutrients important for bone health.

The findings were to be presented Tuesday at the virtual annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

""We need to identify mechanisms that will help prevent bone loss in these patients and to make adolescents with obesity more aware of bone health,"" Bredella said in a meeting news release. ""Adolescence is the critical time for bone mass accrual, and any process that interferes with bone accrual during this time can have dire consequences later in life.""

# 5G interactions with bioengineered COVID is no laughing matter

(Natural News)
 In a satirical piece for Under the Button, writer Scott Newman imagines a scenario in which the Chinese Communist Party comes up with a next-generation version of COVID-19.
He jokes that “COVID-20” will be an improvement over the previous rendition thanks to its higher chance of transmission, greater mortality rate, and 5G connectivity.
He wrote: “All that was next was to link the novel coronavirus to 5G networks, enhancing its ability to wreak immunological havoc and break the people’s psychic will.”
That may be an entertaining thought, but the truth is that 5G is no laughing matter. In fact, it’s already quite threatening on its own and could end up causing bioweapon-level destruction without help from any viruses. The CCP and any other groups that wish to wreak havoc don’t need to bother creating a 5G-equipped virus because the technology is already infecting much of the world on its own.
Scientists have long been sounding warning bells about the dangers of 5G, and while some areas are taking these concerns seriously and halting rollouts, others are moving forward at full throttle.
We should all be concerned about 5G
One big problem is the fact that the FCC is sticking to exposure limits for radiofrequency radiation that date back to the 1990s. Think about it for a minute: Back then, we did not have 5G, 4G, 3G or even 2G; wireless communications were dramatically different in the ‘90s and to say that the standards are outdated is an understatement.
We have learned quite a lot about the dangers since then, and although we don’t have a lot of long-term studies given how little time these technologies have been in use, that’s precisely what is so frightening here.
With 5G comes the introduction of the use of millimeter waves, and that takes this technology to an even greater level of danger. Short-term exposure to millimeter waves can impact the cardiovascular and nervous systems as well as the immune system, which means that being exposed to 5G might just reduce your body’s ability to fight off illnesses like COVID-19. Your skin and cornea can absorb these waves, putting you at risk of melanoma and ocular melanoma as well as sterility. And if someone like China does come up with a bioweapon, our systems will be quite vulnerable.
Plus, 5G has a very limited reach, so cell antennas are going to be placed roughly every 100 to 200 meters. That means they’ll be pretty much everywhere, so even if you don’t get a 5G-enabled phone or opt not to use it, you’ll probably be exposed anyway. Many of us won’t really have a lot of choice in the matter.
Another big warning was issued by the International EMF Scientist Appeal, which was signed by more than 200 scientists across more than 40 nations, all of whom have published peer-reviewed research on the health and biological effects of non-ionizing radiation and radiofrequency radiation in wireless communications. Sent to the World Heath Organization and the United Nations, the letter identifies concerns such as reproductive system problems, cellular stress, a higher risk of cancer, learning and memory defects and neurological disorders as some of the risks of the technology, and they point out that it also affects plants as well as animals.
Even the well-respected, pro-science publication Scientific American’s editorial board has printed a piece against 5G, which some have likened to a “global human experiment without consent.”
So while the idea of a “new and improved” COVID with 5G capabilities might be worth a laugh or two in some corners, the truth is that 5G is pretty scary on its own and doesn’t need the help of any bioweapons to wreak havoc across the planet.

# Coronavirus UK: Sussex and Herefordshire cases soar as Tiers decided

Advertisement

An interactive module has today revealed how quickly coronavirus outbreaks are growing in every local authority in England as millions wait for Boris Johnson to declare which areas will be subject to Tier Three restrictions when the second national lockdown ends next week.

As Britain approached Autumn only five of around 200 local authorities had a weekly Covid-19 infection rate above 100 cases per 100,000 people. Only 24 areas still have an infection rate that is in the double figures.

East Sussex, Herefordshire and Milton Keynes were the local authorities in England that suffered the biggest spikes in coronavirus cases during the most recent week, making them among the most likely to enter Tier Three rules that force restaurants to move to takeaway only.

Public Health England statistics show infection rates — the number of new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people — shot up by at least 50 per cent in all three areas in the seven-day spell ending November 15. Kent, parts of Essex and London also saw large rises, according to the data MailOnline has used to make an interactive tool.

Meanwhile, the areas that saw the greatest falls in cases were almost all in Tier Three in the North West, adding further evidence that the local lockdown system appears to work. Warrington, Oldham, Wigan and Blackburn, all of which suffered huge numbers of infections during England's second wave, saw declines of 30 per cent or more.

Boris Johnson last night confirmed the country's second draconian lockdown will end on December 2, with No10 opting to return to a revamped three-tier system that could have to remain in place until at least March 31 — more than a year after the first lockdown began.

Ministers are waiting for the most up-to-date data to decide what brackets individual authorities will be placed in, with the breakdown set to be published on Thursday. Policymakers will analyse rates of infections, test positivity and speed of outbreak growth to decide on the measures.

The worst-hit areas including Hull and the North West are expected to be placed under the toughest Tier Three, which forces restaurants and pubs to shut — unless they offer takeaways.

Debate rages on over which bracket London should be in, with the capital's mayor Sadiq Khan predicting the city will face Tier Two — which bans mixing indoors with other households. But senior Tories including Sir Iain Duncan Smith last night demanded the city, the beating heart of the UK's economy, is put under Tier One.

Northern mayors have voiced opposition to plans to put them into higher tiers, with Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham saying they could trigger 'widespread business failure' in the region. MPs have warned T2 and T3 will be 'catastrophic' for businesses and spark a damaging new mutiny.

Whitehall sources told the Daily Mail last night that very few areas would be afforded Tier One restrictions, with only the rural regions — such as Cornwall and South Oxfordshire — likely to see the lightest rules applied.

Britain today recorded 11,299 Covid-19 cases in the lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks, but deaths rose again to 608 which is the highest toll since May.

‹ Slide me › Above are infections before winter in September (right) and those on November 18 (left) after the second lockdown

Covid-19 cases have fallen across most of the North of England since lockdown was imposed, but they are rising in a corner of the South East. The percentage change is based on comparing data from the week ending November 15 to the week ending November 8. It comes as the Government prepares to unveil its tier system

The onerous tiered system will be in place across England from December 3 until the end of March, the Prime Minister said

COVID RESTRICTIONS WILL BE EASED OVER CHRISTMAS FOR FIVE DAYS, OFFICIALS CONFIRM Coronavirus restrictions will be eased across the UK for five days at Christmas to allow up to three households to meet indoors after the four home nations agreed a joint plan to loosen draconian curbs over the festive period. A four-nation meeting of the Cobra emergency committee agreed the proposals this afternoon. The relaxed measures will be in place from Wednesday December 23 to Sunday December 27, paving the way for families in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to meet up. It came after Nicola Sturgeon had earlier suggested the Christmas respite from coronavirus lockdown would not be entirely the same in Scotland. The First Minister said she hoped there would be an agreement on a 'common framework' for the festive season. But she hinted at splits between the nations saying the 'precise definition of household' is likely to vary. Scotland currently has different rules on gatherings compared to England, including not including under-12s in limits on numbers. Meanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has admitted that loosening the restrictions over Christmas will inevitably lead to more cases of the deadly disease. Frantic efforts have been going on for days to find a joint position for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to allow some kind of family Christmas. Advertisement

Today 11,299 Covid-19 cases were recorded in the lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks, but deaths rose to 608 in highest toll since May.

The Prime Minister warned last night: 'We expect more regions to fall, at least temporally, into higher levels than before but by using these tougher tiers and by using rapid turnaround tests on an ever greater scale to drive R below one.'

But he added the toughened tiers should make it possible for local authorities 'to move down the tier-ing scale to lower levels of restrictions' as cases start to plummet.

The previous system was heavily criticised for putting areas into Tier Three and then seemingly giving them no clear-cut way out of the curbs.

Toughest restrictions are likely to be applied to areas with the highest infection rates as well as those that have been growing the fastest in recent weeks.

Public Health England data shows a North-South divide that is seeing positive rates increasing faster in parts of the South of the country and in London, while rates are highest – but falling fastest – in the North.

This is likely a legacy of the original three-tier system which saw much of Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire thrust into the toughest local rules before the national lockdown while much of the South didn't have any at all.

North Lincolnshire was the only part of the country further north than the Midlands that featured in the top 20 places with the fastest rate of increase in the week up to November 15. The data counts positive test results that came through the Department of Health's official testing programme.

Ten of the top 20 were boroughs of London – Greenwich, Enfield, Merton, Croydon, Havering, Camden, Hammersmith & Fulham, Bromley, Kingston upon Thames and Hackney & the City of London.

Other areas that saw their positive case counts increase by 25 per cent or more in a week were East Sussex, Herefordshire, Milton Keynes, Kent, Medway, Southend-on-Sea, Slough, North Lincolnshire, Bedford and Cornwall.

Meanwhile, 17 out of the 20 areas that saw the biggest falls in their infection rates during the same week were all ones that were in Tier Three, with the exception only of Torbay in Devon, North East Lincolnshire and Derby.

Local authorities which had been in the toughest local rules before England's national lockdown on November 5 but then saw infections drop by 18 per cent or more in the second week of November were: St Helens, Wirral, Knowsley and Warrington in Merseyside; Manchester, Bury, Tameside, Rochdale, Trafford, Salford, Wigan and Oldham in Greater Manchester; and Doncaster, Sheffield, Nottingham and Blackburn with Darwen.

WHAT ARE THE NEW TIER RULES? Tier One will be the default and measures will not be allowed to get more relaxed in any part of England: Rule of six and social distancing apply to gatherings indoors and outdoors;

Pubs and restaurants are allowed to open with table service only and an 11pm closing time. Tier Two: People from separate households cannot meet indoors and the rule of six applies outside;

Pubs must close unless operating as restaurants, with alcoholic drinks served alongside meals; Tier Three will be the toughest level of restrictions and rules have been tightened up to make them stricter than before. All of the Tier Two rules apply as well as the following: Indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, theatres and bowling alleys must close;

Pubs, restaurants and cafes must close except for takeaway;

Shops and hairdressers and salons will be allowed to remain open;

Groups of six will be allowed to meet outdoors only;

Crowds at live events will be banned;

People should avoid travelling out of, or into, Tier Three areas unless it is unavoidable. Advertisement

Politicians and local leaders are today gathering to mount substantial challenges to the restrictions.

In the capital, Tory heavyweight Sir Iain has told the Telegraph that it 'must' be placed in Tier One to revive the country.

'London is dominant in the economy and we need it to get back to work immediately,' he said.

Another London MP told the Guardian they were 'fiercely lobbying' for pubs, bars and restaurants to be re-opened in the capital.

Sadiq Khan told LBC yesterday: 'It's a bit early to say yet, but based on the numbers that I've seen, which is a slowdown in the virus spreading, it's coming down in parts of London in a couple of boroughs.'

'What I hope would happen is... London would probably be in what is called Tier Two.'

None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures from the seven-day spell ending November 15, the latest date for which data is available.

But in 20 of the 32 boroughs the infection rate rose last week, with the biggest jumps in Havering, Enfield and Redbridge.

The highest infection rate is in Havering, in the north-east of the city, the only borough where they surged above 300 per 100,000.

The number of patients being rushed to hospital in the capital suffering from Covid-19 remains low, according to the Department of Health, at a seven-day average of 154.7 admissions on November 17. But this is far below the peak of the first wave, when on average 748 patients were being taken to hospital with Covid-19 every day.

These levels are also among the lowest in the country, which ministers are expected to argue mean that London can be spared the sharpest curbs on public freedoms.

Mayors in the North of England are also mounting opposition to yet again being placed under higher tiers, with Sheffield city leader Dan Jarvis warning: 'We're willing to do our bit, but we must not be taken for granted.'

Daily hospitalisation rates with Covid-19 across England Region North East&Yorks Midland North West London South East South West East of England Daily admissions 360.7 354.7 239.4 154.7 150.3 110.4 97.9 % change -8.2% -5.5% -14.8% +12.3% +9.5% -8.3% +6.1% This data is based on the latest figures from the Department of Health. Daily admissions is the seven-day average of admissions to November 17. And % change is based on the difference between the average on November 17 and November 10. Advertisement

He added: 'Tougher restrictions have had a massive impact on South Yorkshire's economy.

'The Government said it will return to its levelling up agenda after the pandemic, but the brutal reality is we cannot wait that long.

'At Wednesday's Spending Review, the Government has a golden opportunity to deliver on its promises.

'I've pressed Ministers to bring forward major investment, to give the North the best chance of weathering the storm, ensure businesses survive a tough winter and allow us to kick start the job of economic recovery and renewal.'

Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham has come out hard against being plunged into the toughest measures.

Mr Burnham said a toughened Tier Three 'could be devastating for the hospitality industry and will hit cities and the city economy very, very hard indeed'.

Across England Swale, in Kent, has the worst infection rate in the country at 631.7 per 100,000.

Local leaders there have spoken of their 'frustration' that residents appear not to be following restrictions, and taking simple precautions such as wearing a face mask.

Swale's council leader, Roger Truelove, said lockdown rules in the borough were being 'willfully disregarded', with residents regularly not wearing face coverings and ignoring social distancing.

An emergency council meeting was held yesterday to discuss why the district - which is home to about 150,000 and includes the Isle of Sheppey - has seen such rapid growth of the virus.

THERE WAS ENOUGH INFORMATION ON COVID-19 TO ACT IN JANUARY, SAYS SCIENTIST Enough was known about coronavirus in January to act straight away, but the response was delayed, a leading scientist has said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said that while information about the virus was 'uncertain', action could have been taken. At the start of January the World Health Organisation was aware of a cluster of pneumonia cases - with no deaths - in Wuhan, China, and shared detailed information with member states. Speaking at the Imperial College London's Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics's (J-IDEA) symposium on a post-Covid world, Sir Jeremy said the response to the information was delayed. He said: 'The information you have early may be uncertain, but it's enough to act on. 'I would say that at the end of January we knew enough to have acted. And we waited. 'We waited out of uncertainty, we wanted to be more certain than we needed to be. 'But by the end of January, we knew that this was able to transmit asymptomatically, that it caused a nasty clinical syndrome and a significant number of people were dying, that healthcare workers were getting sick and distant family members were getting sick when people moved from Wuhan to Sichuan, that this was going out of China into other parts of south-east Asia, that we had no diagnostics, no treatment and no vaccines. 'To me, at the time - and this is not in retrospect - I think that was enough to have acted then in ways that we delayed.' Advertisement

The latest analysis of PHE figures, by the Press Association news agency, found Covid-19 case rates started to fall in most local areas across England in the most recent week, up to November 15.

Only two of nine regions - London and the South East - are still recording week-on-week rises in cases. The full impact of England's second national lockdown, however, is yet to become apparent in the data.

It takes up to two weeks for someone who has caught the virus to show symptoms, get tested, and receive a positive result. This means that many infections currently being reported may have occurred before the emergency measures were brought in.

But the latest figures suggest the numbers are heading in the right direction, though not in all parts of England.

The nationwide restrictions began on November 5, and the most recent figures are for the week ending November 15 – just 14 days into the lockdown.

Infection surges were recorded in 34 out of 67 local authorities in the South East, with Medway seeing the biggest jump.

Medway, in Kent, had the sixth biggest surge in infections in the country when they rose by 39.3 per cent to 299 per 100,000.

But the biggest week-on-week falls were recorded in the North West - signalling that earlier measures were helping to drive down cases alongside the lockdown.

Warrington saw the biggest fall in England, where infections dropped by 32.5 per cent to 259.6 per 100,000.

It was followed by Oldham, in Greater Manchester, where infections fell by 30.7 per cent to 519.2 per 100,000.

And Wigan saw the third biggest fall with a 30.3 per cent drop to 403.2 per 100,000.

When the tiered system returns on December 3, they will be reviewed every two weeks to establish whether local authorities need to have stricter curbs imposed or can be dropped to lower restrictions.

It is set to be in place until March 31, at which point the tiered system will come to an end.

Boris Johnson said last night that he hoped the country would be able to get back to normal 'by Easter', predicting this could be when the elderly and most vulnerable members of the population will have received a Covid-19 vaccine.

Three vaccines - including Oxford's jab - have said they are at least 70 per cent effective at triggering an immune response, prompting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to say 'the end of the tunnel' of the pandemic is in sight.

GRANT SHAPPS URGES BRITONS NOT TO USE TRAINS AT CHRISTMAS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE TOO BUSY Grant Shapps today urged Britons not to use trains at Christmas because they will be 'too busy' - as UK ministers meet to thrash out a plan to ease coronavirus rules so family reunions can happen. An announcement is imminent on proposals for a loosening over the festive season, with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove due to chair a Cobra meeting with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But the Transport Secretary has warned that the rail network's 'limitations', with major engineering work and capacity constraints, mean people should avoid using it where possible. In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Shapps said: 'We are going to be appealing to people to look very carefully at the transport route they take and of course even making a choice about whether they travel at all.' News on how restrictions on socialising will be relaxed for a few days - probably from December 23-27 - had been expected today, but might now come later in the week, as sources say 'details need ironing out'. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there could be a 'slight and careful' easing of the rules for a few days while Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething has suggested tough measures to control the virus before Christmas could allow 'more headroom for the festive season'. Mr Gove is set to chair a meeting with the devolved administrations later, in a bid to get the package over the line. Advertisement

The UK has ordered 100million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, with up to four million set to arrive this year. It is also expecting the first part of a delivery of 40million doses from Pfizer and BioNtech - who say their vaccine is 90 per cent effective - by the end of the year, and five million doses from Moderna - with a 94.5 per cent effective shot - in the spring next year.

Leaked NHS plans reveal they could start vaccinating the elderly and most vulnerable against the virus in early December, with vaccines being rolled out to the rest of the population in the new year.

But scientists have urged caution, warning none of the jabs have yet been approved for use by the UK's regulator the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The regulator reviews data on vaccine effectiveness and how safe it is before deciding whether or not to allow it to be administered across the country. It is a process that usually takes two years but, amid pressure to get life back to normal, the regulator has said it is working hard to make a decision quickly.

The Prime Minister detailed his winter strategy yesterday, with a plan to deploy a major testing scheme in an attempt to win over rebels on the Conservative backbenches.

He told tell MPs that non-essential shops can open in all three tiers after the current restrictions expire on December 2, in a boost for retailers.

Mr Johnson also set out the basis of plans to allow a small number of households across the UK to mix over a limited number of days around Christmas.

Vaccines and tiers – all your questions answered

When are we coming out of national lockdown?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the national lockdown imposed on November 5 will come to an end on December 2.

However, England will then move back into a regional tiered system of restrictions – similar to those introduced earlier this year.

What is the tier system?

There are three different tiers of restrictions, which will be imposed at a regional level depending on the number of coronavirus cases in that area.

Those living under Tier 1 restrictions will have the greatest freedoms, while people in Tiers 2 and 3 will face stricter measures.

Official testing data shows that coronavirus infection rates are falling across the North of England, where they were highest during the peak of the second wave, but they remain high in some areas of the West Midlands, Kent, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire (Darker colours indicate higher rates of positive tests per 100,000 people)

LONDON LOCKDOWN REVOLT: MPS WARN PUTTING CAPITAL IN T3 WOULD BE A 'DISASTER' In 20 of London's 32 regions last week there were increases in infection rates. The biggest jumps being Havering (up from 309.4 to 386.0), Enfield (up from 175.6 to 230.4) and Redbridge (up from 249.0 to 300.4) Boris Johnson has been warned by furious London Tories that it would be an economic 'disaster' if the capital was hit with the toughest possible coronavirus restrictions after lockdown ends. City MPs and the Conservative candidate for mayor, Shaun Bailey, sent the Prime Minister a clear warning after it emerged officials could place the metropolis into the top Tier 3 after December 2. They warned such a move could cripple London's entertainment and hospitality industries, with pubs and restaurants open for takeaway and delivery sales only and theatres and other venues remaining closed. None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures. But speaking to business leaders via Zoom last night, Mr Bailey said: 'I absolutely agree it would be a disaster for London if we were in Tier 3. Advertisement

How will they decide on what tier to introduce?

Regions with high numbers of cases will face tighter measures, while those with fewer cases will have their restrictions relaxed.

To decide which tier to apply to a specific area, officials will look at coronavirus cases across all age groups, and specifically among the over-60s who are considered most at risk.

They will also consider whether infection rates are rising or falling and the prevalence of the disease per 100,000 of the population.

When will I find out what tier I'm in?

An announcement will be made on Thursday.

What is allowed under each tier?

Under Tier 1, people can meet a maximum of six friends or family outdoors or indoors.

Pubs and restaurants can reopen, but with table service only and an 11pm closing time.

In Tier 2, people from two different households cannot mix indoors, and outdoor gatherings will be limited to six.

Pubs will remain closed unless operating as restaurants, with alcohol only served as part of a 'substantial meal'.

Retail and personal care – such as hairdressers and beauty salons – can reopen in all tiers, and indoor entertainment venues – such as cinemas, theatres, bowling alleys and casinos – will be allowed to stay open in Tiers 1 and 2, but not Tier 3.

Tier 3 areas will see the hospitality sector remain closed except for takeaways, and groups of six will only be able to meet in outdoor public spaces.

Can I travel between tiers?

People in Tier 3 areas should avoid travelling to other parts of the UK, including for overnight stays unless it is for work, education, health or care requirements.

Likewise, those in Tier 1 and 2 areas should not travel to Tier 3 zones, but can pass through them as part of a longer journey.

Should I start making plans for Christmas?

Not just yet. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was unable to confirm on Monday any details as to how people would be able to spend the festive period.

However, a plan to allow families to be reunited for Christmas is being developed with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

HANCOCK CLAIMS T3 WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH BEFORE LOCKDOWN Matt Hancock has claimed Tier Three restrictions imposed before lockdown were not tough enough to halt the spread of Covid-19, and revealed he hopes damaging restrictions on Britons lives will be lifted after Easter. Speaking to Parliament's Health and Social Care Committee, the 'architect' of the tiered system said he was convinced a second lockdown was needed when cases suddenly surged in all areas of England. The then-spiralling numbers, he said, meant that 'even in the lower prevalence areas you could see they were going to get to high prevalence if we didn't act'. Public Health England data reveals the sharpest spike in infections across England was in the week ending October 4, when almost every local authority saw Covid-19 infections surge by more than 50 per cent. Ministers then rushed out the tiered system - which came into force on October 14 - in an attempt to suppress escalating cases. But just 23 days later - and amid growing evidence that Tier Three was driving down infections - they hit the nuclear button and imposed a second nationwide lockdown. The Health Secretary and Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove are thought to have been the main supporters of the stringent measures in the cabinet. Mr Hancock appeared today in front of the committee to answer questions on the Government's handling of the pandemic, including whether Test and Trace is working, whether the first lockdown was imposed early enough and why a circuit breaker was avoided. Boris Johnson yesterday unveiled his beefed-up tier system, with Tier Three now forcing all restaurants and bars to shift to take-away only. Advertisement

Is there a vaccine yet?

Not quite. Although vaccine developers have started to publish the interim results from their trials, which have so far been positive.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca team announced its vaccine had proved up to 90% effective.

When will it be ready?

No one can be certain at this stage as no vaccine has been approved for use yet.

But the jab is likely to be rolled out in the UK from December, with the bulk of vaccination in the new year.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, if all goes well in the next couple of weeks, the vaccination programme could potentially be rolled out from next month for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.

Will I have to pay for a jab?

No, the vaccine will be free on the NHS.

Will there be enough for everyone?

The Government said it has secured access to more than 350 million doses of vaccine from seven developers between now and the end of 2021, which is enough to potentially vaccinate the whole population.

Do I have to get a vaccine?

There are no plans to make vaccination compulsory, Downing Street said earlier in November.

However, Mr Hancock has also refused to rule out making it mandatory.

How long will immunity last?

The Government said in its Covid Winter Plan that the exact strength and duration of immunity provided through vaccination is not yet known.

Protection through vaccination takes time to build and requires a full course, but it is still unknown how well the first vaccines will stop the virus from passing between people.

Can I choose what vaccine I get?

As things stand, the vaccines will be rolled out as and when they become available, depending on which are approved first and how quickly companies can make them.

No announcement has been made on whether one might be given priority over another as they become ready on a mass scale.

People are not expected to be able to choose which jab they want to receive.

When will life return to normal?

While it is not known exactly how long it might take for the population to be vaccinated, Mr Hancock has said it is looking as though things may start returning to normal after Easter.

But until then, and until there is some kind of herd immunity in the population, achieved through vaccination, people will need to continue to wear face masks, socially distance and wash their hands.";"(2020-04-16)

# Tired All the Time? It Could Be Your Diabetes

If you’re coping with diabetes and feel wiped out all the time — the kind of fatigue that isn’t helped by eating or getting a little extra sleep — it’s possible that type 2 diabetes is what’s dragging you down.

After all, people with type 2 diabetes are roughly 10 times more likely to experience fatigue compared with those without the chronic condition, according to a study on adults with the condition.

“Glucose is a major source of energy for all cells in our body, especially the brain,” explains Deena Adimoolam, MD, an endocrinologist at Mount Sinai in New York City and a spokesperson for the Endocrine Society. “With type 2 diabetes, though, glucose levels are high and the glucose is unable to enter the cells, meaning the cells have less energy overall to function. As a result, one experiences generalized fatigue.” To make matters worse, both excessively high and low blood sugar levels can further spur fatigue, she says.

But that’s not the end of it. “Fatigue with type 2 diabetes is usually multifactorial,” Dr. Adimoolam says. In fact, research shows that stress, depression, increased body mass index (BMI), and a lack of exercise can all be significant contributors to fatigue in people with type 2 diabetes. Adimoolam notes that all of these factors can independently decrease insulin sensitivity, making it even harder for insulin to deliver glucose from the bloodstream into tissues, including those in the heart, brain, and muscles.

Meanwhile, many people with type 2 diabetes also have coexisting conditions such as heart disease, kidney damage, and dehydration; these can further increase fatigue, according to Adimoolam. Many medications for hypertension are known to cause fatigue.

Diabetes Fatigue: How to Get Your Energy Back

Take a proactive approach to dealing with fatigue by addressing your symptoms and concerns with your healthcare providers and support team. Following these steps can help:

Talk to your doctor. First things first: Evaluate your blood sugar levels and work with your primary care doctor or endocrinologist to get them into healthy ranges, if they aren’t already. If your blood sugar is in a healthy range, however, it’s important to work with your doctor to figure out exactly what’s going on for you, Adimoolam says.

When talking to your doctor about how you feel, don’t just say, “I’m tired all the time.” Tell your doctor, 'I’m too tired to go for a walk or go grocery shopping,'” says Cynthia Fritschi, PhD, CDCES, an associate professor of biobehavioral nursing science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Let your doctor know that exhaustion is preventing you from doing activities that are important to keeping you healthy.

Try keeping a journal to track your symptoms: How many times do you get up at night to go to the bathroom? Are you skipping meals because you’re too tired to stand and prepare them? Take detailed notes on your daily habits and use your journal to talk to your doctor or diabetes educator about concerns that make living with type 2 diabetes harder for you, she says.

RELATED: Do You Have Type 2 Diabetes Burnout?

Be as active as possible. “One of the key strategies for taking care of diabetes is exercise, yet people with diabetes can be too tired to exercise,"" Fritschi says.

Fortunately, you don’t have to perform intense workouts to enjoy an energy and mood boost from exercise: Any form of regular physical activity, regardless of exercise limitations, reduces stress, according to a study published in June 2018 in the Journal of Exercise Rehabilitation. Set small, achievable activity goals, such as taking a daily walk or stretching, and increase your movement goals as you feel able.

Care for your mental health. Managing diabetes is a 24/7 commitment. That alone can cause you to feel anxious, stressed, or depressed. And, in turn, depression can lead to fatigue and a lack of energy, Fritschi says. According to a study of 90,686 people published in the February-March 2016 issue of the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, people with diabetes are 2 to 3 times more likely to experience depression compared with people without the condition.

If you feel burdened and depressed by diabetes, consider getting professional help. A therapist who is trained in treating depression can help you improve your mental health. Ask your doctor or diabetes educator for a recommendation.

Connect with your peers. Talking with others affected by diabetes can also provide some relief. Discussing day-to-day challenges, worries, and emotions with peers who have experienced similar situations can help you manage stress and brainstorm coping strategies, suggests the American Diabetes Association. Ask your diabetes educator about local support groups or become a member of an diabetes online community for virtual conversation.

RELATED: The Best Diabetes Apps of the Year

Aim for quality sleep. As many as half of all people with diabetes may have trouble sleeping, Fritschi says. Stress, anxiety, and depression can all contribute to insomnia, while frequently having to wake up in the night to urinate can also worsen overall sleep quality.

If you’re not sleeping well at night, you're going to be tired during the day. Modifying your evening routine and sleep environment can help you get more rest, she says. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends; keep your bedroom cool and dark; and turn off electronics (the computer and the TV) before going to bed, recommends the National Sleep Foundation. If you are concerned you may have a sleep disorder, speak with your doctor about evaluating your sleep.

# Coronavirus UK: Sussex and Herefordshire cases soar as Tiers decided

Advertisement

An interactive module has today revealed how quickly coronavirus outbreaks are growing in every local authority in England as millions wait for Boris Johnson to declare which areas will be subject to Tier Three restrictions when the second national lockdown ends next week.

As Britain approached Autumn only five of around 200 local authorities had a weekly Covid-19 infection rate above 100 cases per 100,000 people. Only 24 areas still have an infection rate that is in the double figures.

East Sussex, Herefordshire and Milton Keynes were the local authorities in England that suffered the biggest spikes in coronavirus cases during the most recent week, making them among the most likely to enter Tier Three rules that force restaurants to move to takeaway only.

Public Health England statistics show infection rates — the number of new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people — shot up by at least 50 per cent in all three areas in the seven-day spell ending November 15. Kent, parts of Essex and London also saw large rises, according to the data MailOnline has used to make an interactive tool.

Meanwhile, the areas that saw the greatest falls in cases were almost all in Tier Three in the North West, adding further evidence that the local lockdown system appears to work. Warrington, Oldham, Wigan and Blackburn, all of which suffered huge numbers of infections during England's second wave, saw declines of 30 per cent or more.

Boris Johnson last night confirmed the country's second draconian lockdown will end on December 2, with No10 opting to return to a revamped three-tier system that could have to remain in place until at least March 31 — more than a year after the first lockdown began.

Ministers are waiting for the most up-to-date data to decide what brackets individual authorities will be placed in, with the breakdown set to be published on Thursday. Policymakers will analyse rates of infections, test positivity and speed of outbreak growth to decide on the measures.

The worst-hit areas including Hull and the North West are expected to be placed under the toughest Tier Three, which forces restaurants and pubs to shut — unless they offer takeaways.

Debate rages on over which bracket London should be in, with the capital's mayor Sadiq Khan predicting the city will face Tier Two — which bans mixing indoors with other households. But senior Tories including Sir Iain Duncan Smith last night demanded the city, the beating heart of the UK's economy, is put under Tier One.

Northern mayors have voiced opposition to plans to put them into higher tiers, with Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham saying they could trigger 'widespread business failure' in the region. MPs have warned T2 and T3 will be 'catastrophic' for businesses and spark a damaging new mutiny.

Whitehall sources told the Daily Mail last night that very few areas would be afforded Tier One restrictions, with only the rural regions — such as Cornwall and South Oxfordshire — likely to see the lightest rules applied.

Britain today recorded 11,299 Covid-19 cases in the lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks, but deaths rose again to 608 which is the highest toll since May.

Covid-19 cases have fallen across most of the North of England since lockdown was imposed, but they are rising in a corner of the South East. The percentage change is based on comparing data from the week ending November 15 to the week ending November 8. It comes as the Government prepares to unveil its tier system

The onerous tiered system will be in place across England from December 3 until the end of March, the Prime Minister said

COVID RESTRICTIONS WILL BE EASED OVER CHRISTMAS FOR FIVE DAYS, OFFICIALS CONFIRM Coronavirus restrictions will be eased across the UK for five days at Christmas to allow up to three households to meet indoors after the four home nations agreed a joint plan to loosen draconian curbs over the festive period. A four-nation meeting of the Cobra emergency committee agreed the proposals this afternoon. The relaxed measures will be in place from Wednesday December 23 to Sunday December 27, paving the way for families in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to meet up. It came after Nicola Sturgeon had earlier suggested the Christmas respite from coronavirus lockdown would not be entirely the same in Scotland. The First Minister said she hoped there would be an agreement on a 'common framework' for the festive season. But she hinted at splits between the nations saying the 'precise definition of household' is likely to vary. Scotland currently has different rules on gatherings compared to England, including not including under-12s in limits on numbers. Meanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has admitted that loosening the restrictions over Christmas will inevitably lead to more cases of the deadly disease. Frantic efforts have been going on for days to find a joint position for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to allow some kind of family Christmas. Advertisement

Today 11,299 Covid-19 cases were recorded in the lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks, but deaths rose to 608 in highest toll since May.

The Prime Minister warned last night: 'We expect more regions to fall, at least temporally, into higher levels than before but by using these tougher tiers and by using rapid turnaround tests on an ever greater scale to drive R below one.'

But he added the toughened tiers should make it possible for local authorities 'to move down the tier-ing scale to lower levels of restrictions' as cases start to plummet.

The previous system was heavily criticised for putting areas into Tier Three and then seemingly giving them no clear-cut way out of the curbs.

Toughest restrictions are likely to be applied to areas with the highest infection rates as well as those that have been growing the fastest in recent weeks.

Public Health England data shows a North-South divide that is seeing positive rates increasing faster in parts of the South of the country and in London, while rates are highest – but falling fastest – in the North.

This is likely a legacy of the original three-tier system which saw much of Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire thrust into the toughest local rules before the national lockdown while much of the South didn't have any at all.

North Lincolnshire was the only part of the country further north than the Midlands that featured in the top 20 places with the fastest rate of increase in the week up to November 15. The data counts positive test results that came through the Department of Health's official testing programme.

Ten of the top 20 were boroughs of London – Greenwich, Enfield, Merton, Croydon, Havering, Camden, Hammersmith & Fulham, Bromley, Kingston upon Thames and Hackney & the City of London.

Other areas that saw their positive case counts increase by 25 per cent or more in a week were East Sussex, Herefordshire, Milton Keynes, Kent, Medway, Southend-on-Sea, Slough, North Lincolnshire, Bedford and Cornwall.

Meanwhile, 17 out of the 20 areas that saw the biggest falls in their infection rates during the same week were all ones that were in Tier Three, with the exception only of Torbay in Devon, North East Lincolnshire and Derby.

Local authorities which had been in the toughest local rules before England's national lockdown on November 5 but then saw infections drop by 18 per cent or more in the second week of November were: St Helens, Wirral, Knowsley and Warrington in Merseyside; Manchester, Bury, Tameside, Rochdale, Trafford, Salford, Wigan and Oldham in Greater Manchester; and Doncaster, Sheffield, Nottingham and Blackburn with Darwen.

WHAT ARE THE NEW TIER RULES? Tier One will be the default and measures will not be allowed to get more relaxed in any part of England: Rule of six and social distancing apply to gatherings indoors and outdoors;

Pubs and restaurants are allowed to open with table service only and an 11pm closing time. Tier Two: People from separate households cannot meet indoors and the rule of six applies outside;

Pubs must close unless operating as restaurants, with alcoholic drinks served alongside meals; Tier Three will be the toughest level of restrictions and rules have been tightened up to make them stricter than before. All of the Tier Two rules apply as well as the following: Indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, theatres and bowling alleys must close;

Pubs, restaurants and cafes must close except for takeaway;

Shops and hairdressers and salons will be allowed to remain open;

Groups of six will be allowed to meet outdoors only;

Crowds at live events will be banned;

People should avoid travelling out of, or into, Tier Three areas unless it is unavoidable. Advertisement

Politicians and local leaders are today gathering to mount substantial challenges to the restrictions.

In the capital, Tory heavyweight Sir Iain has told the Telegraph that it 'must' be placed in Tier One to revive the country.

'London is dominant in the economy and we need it to get back to work immediately,' he said.

Another London MP told the Guardian they were 'fiercely lobbying' for pubs, bars and restaurants to be re-opened in the capital.

Sadiq Khan told LBC yesterday: 'It's a bit early to say yet, but based on the numbers that I've seen, which is a slowdown in the virus spreading, it's coming down in parts of London in a couple of boroughs.'

'What I hope would happen is... London would probably be in what is called Tier Two.'

None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures from the seven-day spell ending November 15, the latest date for which data is available.

But in 20 of the 32 boroughs the infection rate rose last week, with the biggest jumps in Havering, Enfield and Redbridge.

The highest infection rate is in Havering, in the north-east of the city, the only borough where they surged above 300 per 100,000.

The number of patients being rushed to hospital in the capital suffering from Covid-19 remains low, according to the Department of Health, at a seven-day average of 154.7 admissions on November 17. But this is far below the peak of the first wave, when on average 748 patients were being taken to hospital with Covid-19 every day.

These levels are also among the lowest in the country, which ministers are expected to argue mean that London can be spared the sharpest curbs on public freedoms.

Mayors in the North of England are also mounting opposition to yet again being placed under higher tiers, with Sheffield city leader Dan Jarvis warning: 'We're willing to do our bit, but we must not be taken for granted.'

Daily hospitalisation rates with Covid-19 across England Region North East&Yorks Midland North West London South East South West East of England Daily admissions 360.7 354.7 239.4 154.7 150.3 110.4 97.9 % change -8.2% -5.5% -14.8% +12.3% +9.5% -8.3% +6.1% This data is based on the latest figures from the Department of Health. Daily admissions is the seven-day average of admissions to November 17. And % change is based on the difference between the average on November 17 and November 10. Advertisement

He added: 'Tougher restrictions have had a massive impact on South Yorkshire's economy.

'The Government said it will return to its levelling up agenda after the pandemic, but the brutal reality is we cannot wait that long.

'At Wednesday's Spending Review, the Government has a golden opportunity to deliver on its promises.

'I've pressed Ministers to bring forward major investment, to give the North the best chance of weathering the storm, ensure businesses survive a tough winter and allow us to kick start the job of economic recovery and renewal.'

Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham has come out hard against being plunged into the toughest measures.

Mr Burnham said a toughened Tier Three 'could be devastating for the hospitality industry and will hit cities and the city economy very, very hard indeed'.

Across England Swale, in Kent, has the worst infection rate in the country at 631.7 per 100,000.

Local leaders there have spoken of their 'frustration' that residents appear not to be following restrictions, and taking simple precautions such as wearing a face mask.

Swale's council leader, Roger Truelove, said lockdown rules in the borough were being 'willfully disregarded', with residents regularly not wearing face coverings and ignoring social distancing.

An emergency council meeting was held yesterday to discuss why the district - which is home to about 150,000 and includes the Isle of Sheppey - has seen such rapid growth of the virus.

THERE WAS ENOUGH INFORMATION ON COVID-19 TO ACT IN JANUARY, SAYS SCIENTIST Enough was known about coronavirus in January to act straight away, but the response was delayed, a leading scientist has said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said that while information about the virus was 'uncertain', action could have been taken. At the start of January the World Health Organisation was aware of a cluster of pneumonia cases - with no deaths - in Wuhan, China, and shared detailed information with member states. Speaking at the Imperial College London's Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics's (J-IDEA) symposium on a post-Covid world, Sir Jeremy said the response to the information was delayed. He said: 'The information you have early may be uncertain, but it's enough to act on. 'I would say that at the end of January we knew enough to have acted. And we waited. 'We waited out of uncertainty, we wanted to be more certain than we needed to be. 'But by the end of January, we knew that this was able to transmit asymptomatically, that it caused a nasty clinical syndrome and a significant number of people were dying, that healthcare workers were getting sick and distant family members were getting sick when people moved from Wuhan to Sichuan, that this was going out of China into other parts of south-east Asia, that we had no diagnostics, no treatment and no vaccines. 'To me, at the time - and this is not in retrospect - I think that was enough to have acted then in ways that we delayed.' Advertisement

The latest analysis of PHE figures, by the Press Association news agency, found Covid-19 case rates started to fall in most local areas across England in the most recent week, up to November 15.

Only two of nine regions - London and the South East - are still recording week-on-week rises in cases. The full impact of England's second national lockdown, however, is yet to become apparent in the data.

It takes up to two weeks for someone who has caught the virus to show symptoms, get tested, and receive a positive result. This means that many infections currently being reported may have occurred before the emergency measures were brought in.

But the latest figures suggest the numbers are heading in the right direction, though not in all parts of England.

The nationwide restrictions began on November 5, and the most recent figures are for the week ending November 15 – just 14 days into the lockdown.

Infection surges were recorded in 34 out of 67 local authorities in the South East, with Medway seeing the biggest jump.

Medway, in Kent, had the sixth biggest surge in infections in the country when they rose by 39.3 per cent to 299 per 100,000.

But the biggest week-on-week falls were recorded in the North West - signalling that earlier measures were helping to drive down cases alongside the lockdown.

Warrington saw the biggest fall in England, where infections dropped by 32.5 per cent to 259.6 per 100,000.

It was followed by Oldham, in Greater Manchester, where infections fell by 30.7 per cent to 519.2 per 100,000.

And Wigan saw the third biggest fall with a 30.3 per cent drop to 403.2 per 100,000.

When the tiered system returns on December 3, they will be reviewed every two weeks to establish whether local authorities need to have stricter curbs imposed or can be dropped to lower restrictions.

It is set to be in place until March 31, at which point the tiered system will come to an end.

Boris Johnson said last night that he hoped the country would be able to get back to normal 'by Easter', predicting this could be when the elderly and most vulnerable members of the population will have received a Covid-19 vaccine.

Three vaccines - including Oxford's jab - have said they are at least 70 per cent effective at triggering an immune response, prompting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to say 'the end of the tunnel' of the pandemic is in sight.

GRANT SHAPPS URGES BRITONS NOT TO USE TRAINS AT CHRISTMAS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE TOO BUSY Grant Shapps today urged Britons not to use trains at Christmas because they will be 'too busy' - as UK ministers meet to thrash out a plan to ease coronavirus rules so family reunions can happen. An announcement is imminent on proposals for a loosening over the festive season, with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove due to chair a Cobra meeting with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But the Transport Secretary has warned that the rail network's 'limitations', with major engineering work and capacity constraints, mean people should avoid using it where possible. In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Shapps said: 'We are going to be appealing to people to look very carefully at the transport route they take and of course even making a choice about whether they travel at all.' News on how restrictions on socialising will be relaxed for a few days - probably from December 23-27 - had been expected today, but might now come later in the week, as sources say 'details need ironing out'. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there could be a 'slight and careful' easing of the rules for a few days while Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething has suggested tough measures to control the virus before Christmas could allow 'more headroom for the festive season'. Mr Gove is set to chair a meeting with the devolved administrations later, in a bid to get the package over the line. Advertisement

The UK has ordered 100million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, with up to four million set to arrive this year. It is also expecting the first part of a delivery of 40million doses from Pfizer and BioNtech - who say their vaccine is 90 per cent effective - by the end of the year, and five million doses from Moderna - with a 94.5 per cent effective shot - in the spring next year.

Leaked NHS plans reveal they could start vaccinating the elderly and most vulnerable against the virus in early December, with vaccines being rolled out to the rest of the population in the new year.

But scientists have urged caution, warning none of the jabs have yet been approved for use by the UK's regulator the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The regulator reviews data on vaccine effectiveness and how safe it is before deciding whether or not to allow it to be administered across the country. It is a process that usually takes two years but, amid pressure to get life back to normal, the regulator has said it is working hard to make a decision quickly.

The Prime Minister detailed his winter strategy yesterday, with a plan to deploy a major testing scheme in an attempt to win over rebels on the Conservative backbenches.

He told tell MPs that non-essential shops can open in all three tiers after the current restrictions expire on December 2, in a boost for retailers.

Mr Johnson also set out the basis of plans to allow a small number of households across the UK to mix over a limited number of days around Christmas.

Vaccines and tiers – all your questions answered

When are we coming out of national lockdown?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the national lockdown imposed on November 5 will come to an end on December 2.

However, England will then move back into a regional tiered system of restrictions – similar to those introduced earlier this year.

What is the tier system?

There are three different tiers of restrictions, which will be imposed at a regional level depending on the number of coronavirus cases in that area.

Those living under Tier 1 restrictions will have the greatest freedoms, while people in Tiers 2 and 3 will face stricter measures.

Official testing data shows that coronavirus infection rates are falling across the North of England, where they were highest during the peak of the second wave, but they remain high in some areas of the West Midlands, Kent, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire (Darker colours indicate higher rates of positive tests per 100,000 people)

LONDON LOCKDOWN REVOLT: MPS WARN PUTTING CAPITAL IN T3 WOULD BE A 'DISASTER' In 20 of London's 32 regions last week there were increases in infection rates. The biggest jumps being Havering (up from 309.4 to 386.0), Enfield (up from 175.6 to 230.4) and Redbridge (up from 249.0 to 300.4) Boris Johnson has been warned by furious London Tories that it would be an economic 'disaster' if the capital was hit with the toughest possible coronavirus restrictions after lockdown ends. City MPs and the Conservative candidate for mayor, Shaun Bailey, sent the Prime Minister a clear warning after it emerged officials could place the metropolis into the top Tier 3 after December 2. They warned such a move could cripple London's entertainment and hospitality industries, with pubs and restaurants open for takeaway and delivery sales only and theatres and other venues remaining closed. None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures. But speaking to business leaders via Zoom last night, Mr Bailey said: 'I absolutely agree it would be a disaster for London if we were in Tier 3. Advertisement

How will they decide on what tier to introduce?

Regions with high numbers of cases will face tighter measures, while those with fewer cases will have their restrictions relaxed.

To decide which tier to apply to a specific area, officials will look at coronavirus cases across all age groups, and specifically among the over-60s who are considered most at risk.

They will also consider whether infection rates are rising or falling and the prevalence of the disease per 100,000 of the population.

When will I find out what tier I'm in?

An announcement will be made on Thursday.

What is allowed under each tier?

Under Tier 1, people can meet a maximum of six friends or family outdoors or indoors.

Pubs and restaurants can reopen, but with table service only and an 11pm closing time.

In Tier 2, people from two different households cannot mix indoors, and outdoor gatherings will be limited to six.

Pubs will remain closed unless operating as restaurants, with alcohol only served as part of a 'substantial meal'.

Retail and personal care – such as hairdressers and beauty salons – can reopen in all tiers, and indoor entertainment venues – such as cinemas, theatres, bowling alleys and casinos – will be allowed to stay open in Tiers 1 and 2, but not Tier 3.

Tier 3 areas will see the hospitality sector remain closed except for takeaways, and groups of six will only be able to meet in outdoor public spaces.

Can I travel between tiers?

People in Tier 3 areas should avoid travelling to other parts of the UK, including for overnight stays unless it is for work, education, health or care requirements.

Likewise, those in Tier 1 and 2 areas should not travel to Tier 3 zones, but can pass through them as part of a longer journey.

Should I start making plans for Christmas?

Not just yet. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was unable to confirm on Monday any details as to how people would be able to spend the festive period.

However, a plan to allow families to be reunited for Christmas is being developed with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

HANCOCK CLAIMS T3 WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH BEFORE LOCKDOWN Matt Hancock has claimed Tier Three restrictions imposed before lockdown were not tough enough to halt the spread of Covid-19, and revealed he hopes damaging restrictions on Britons lives will be lifted after Easter. Speaking to Parliament's Health and Social Care Committee, the 'architect' of the tiered system said he was convinced a second lockdown was needed when cases suddenly surged in all areas of England. The then-spiralling numbers, he said, meant that 'even in the lower prevalence areas you could see they were going to get to high prevalence if we didn't act'. Public Health England data reveals the sharpest spike in infections across England was in the week ending October 4, when almost every local authority saw Covid-19 infections surge by more than 50 per cent. Ministers then rushed out the tiered system - which came into force on October 14 - in an attempt to suppress escalating cases. But just 23 days later - and amid growing evidence that Tier Three was driving down infections - they hit the nuclear button and imposed a second nationwide lockdown. The Health Secretary and Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove are thought to have been the main supporters of the stringent measures in the cabinet. Mr Hancock appeared today in front of the committee to answer questions on the Government's handling of the pandemic, including whether Test and Trace is working, whether the first lockdown was imposed early enough and why a circuit breaker was avoided. Boris Johnson yesterday unveiled his beefed-up tier system, with Tier Three now forcing all restaurants and bars to shift to take-away only. Advertisement

Is there a vaccine yet?

Not quite. Although vaccine developers have started to publish the interim results from their trials, which have so far been positive.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca team announced its vaccine had proved up to 90% effective.

When will it be ready?

No one can be certain at this stage as no vaccine has been approved for use yet.

But the jab is likely to be rolled out in the UK from December, with the bulk of vaccination in the new year.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, if all goes well in the next couple of weeks, the vaccination programme could potentially be rolled out from next month for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.

Will I have to pay for a jab?

No, the vaccine will be free on the NHS.

Will there be enough for everyone?

The Government said it has secured access to more than 350 million doses of vaccine from seven developers between now and the end of 2021, which is enough to potentially vaccinate the whole population.

Do I have to get a vaccine?

There are no plans to make vaccination compulsory, Downing Street said earlier in November.

However, Mr Hancock has also refused to rule out making it mandatory.

How long will immunity last?

The Government said in its Covid Winter Plan that the exact strength and duration of immunity provided through vaccination is not yet known.

Protection through vaccination takes time to build and requires a full course, but it is still unknown how well the first vaccines will stop the virus from passing between people.

Can I choose what vaccine I get?

As things stand, the vaccines will be rolled out as and when they become available, depending on which are approved first and how quickly companies can make them.

No announcement has been made on whether one might be given priority over another as they become ready on a mass scale.

People are not expected to be able to choose which jab they want to receive.

When will life return to normal?

While it is not known exactly how long it might take for the population to be vaccinated, Mr Hancock has said it is looking as though things may start returning to normal after Easter.

But until then, and until there is some kind of herd immunity in the population, achieved through vaccination, people will need to continue to wear face masks, socially distance and wash their hands.";"(2019-12-13)

# Amid coronavirus strain, Mayo Clinic puts ER beds in ambulance garage

A top executive with the Mayo Clinic Health System on Tuesday said that amid ongoing, high numbers of coronavirus-related hospitalizations and strained capacity, a number of beds were put in an ambulance garage.

Dr. Richard Helmers, regional vice president of the Mayo Clinic Health System in Northwest Wisconsin, told Fox News the situation is “fluid,” but there are times when all five hospitals in the health system are full.

REDFIELD PROJECTS COVID-19 VACCINE TO BE ROLLED OUT BY 'END OF THE SECOND WEEK IN DECEMBER'

“With limited hospital beds available, we often need to keep patients in our emergency department longer than usual,” Helmers wrote in an email. “We have placed four emergency beds in our ambulance garage at Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire to accommodate busy periods in the emergency department, and we have used these beds in the past week.”

The setup is not used for coronavirus patients, he said.

“While this is not ideal, this is a clean, heated space where we are able to safely care for patients with less serious injuries or conditions,” he said. “We have additional space identified in a seating area inside the department where we can place beds if needed.”

The seating area is not a public area, he said.

Further, patients are separated by booths while waiting for care in the waiting room.

“Mayo Clinic Health System would like to assure the public that we remain open for emergency and trauma care, and patients who require emergency medical care should not hesitate to seek it,” Helmers concluded.

The comments follow news from almost two weeks ago that hospitals within the Mayo Clinic Health System in the northwest region of Wisconsin reached 100% capacity, local outlet WQOW reported. The Mayo Clinic Health System operates hospitals in Barron, Bloomer, Eau Claire, Osseo and Menomonie, per the outlet.

At the time, an estimated 50% of patients in intensive care units had COVID-19, while coronavirus patients occupied 40% of the system's medical or surgical beds.

""The public urgently needs to treat COVID-19 as the health emergency it is to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. We are pleading for everyone’s help to wear a mask and follow all public health guidelines to limit the spread of this disease,"" hospital officials had said in a statement.

# How to Find and Follow a Sleep Routine That’s Right for You

Your body and brain thrive on routine — and part of what sets that routine is a consistent sleep schedule. “Your brain releases hormones that make you sleepy and awake at certain times,” says Samantha Anders, PhD, a Minneapolis-based psychologist in private practice who treats insomnia and sleep disorders.

The more you stick to that schedule, the stronger those sleep and wake signals get (meaning you spend less time tossing and turning before sleep when you turn in and feel more alert when it’s time to wake).

So what’s the ideal schedule for you? The recommendation from the National Sleep Foundation is for adults to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep at night — note that sleep needs change slightly for people of different ages. But health organizations recommend sleep ranges (rather than a specific amount) because we’re all slightly different, too.

“Everyone has a different natural rhythm when it comes to their sleep, which is partly hereditary,” says Dr. Anders. Of course, behavioral habits and lifestyle factors come into play. For example, you may need to wake up at a certain time for work or to get kids off to school, which helps train your body to follow a certain schedule. You may be on electronic devices late at night, and the blue light they emit can shift your clock to a later bedtime.

How to Tell if You’re Getting Enough Sleep

If you’re getting the amount of sleep you personally need, you’ll feel awake and alert all day long. While it’s natural to experience a slight dip in energy in the afternoon, you should not be struggling to stay awake at 3 p.m., says Anders. “You should feel with-it and be able to think clearly.”

Another hint that you’re on track with a sleep schedule that’s working for you is if you feel really sleepy before bedtime.

But, it’s worth pointing out that there are a lot of factors that affect your biological clock and make you feel more or less awake, whether you’re getting enough sleep or not, says Anders. “Light and stimulation are two big ones,” she explains.

What foods you’re eating or drinking, when you’re physically active (or not), stress, and when you’re exposing your eyes to a lot of blue light (either from the sun or screens), can affect how sleepy or awake you feel, too. For example, even if your body is ready for sleep in the evening, artificial light as well as staring at a phone or TV sends signals to the brain to stay awake, says Anders. If you’re feeling anxious about meeting a big deadline at work, stress signals may be overriding signs from your body that you’re actually overtired.

If you’re still unsure whether or not your sleep routine is working for you, think back to the last time you took a weeklong vacation and didn’t have to set an alarm. How much sleep did you need then? Where did your natural sleep patterns fall when you had extended time off and didn’t have to sleep at specific times for work or school? Paying attention to where your body naturally falls when it’s not affected by these external factors will help you uncover the pattern that works best for your body, as well as how much sleep your body really needs.

And if you stick to that pattern (more on how to do that below), the better you’ll feel and function.

The more consistent you are with your sleep the better you’ll feel — and the easier sleep will come, says Alex Dimitriu, MD, a dual-board certified doctor in psychiatry and sleep medicine in private practice in Menlo Park, California. “Everyone thinks that sleep is a one-night commitment, but the annoying thing about sleep is that one night alone will rarely make up for past sleep deprivation,” he says.

Consistent sleep benefits your long-term health, too. Case in point: A study published in August 2019 in Diabetes Care found that irregular bed and wake times were linked to metabolic problems like high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar; for every one hour of variability in sleep schedule, the risk of having metabolic syndrome rose by 27 percent.

My Sleep Schedule Isn’t Working for Me — but I Don’t Have Time to Change It!

If you struggle to prioritize sleep over other responsibilities (or late-night Netflix), and are looking for some additional motivation, focus on what sleep does for you, says Anders. When you get enough do you feel happier? Do you eat better and do better at your job? “It has to be your own individual motivation. Determine how sleep affects what you care about in your life, and it will be easier to make it a priority,” she says.

RELATED: How to Start a Self-Care Routine You’ll Follow

Of course, sometimes it’s not a matter of not being motivated to sleep — it’s a matter of other obligations getting in the way, like crying babies, second jobs, night school, and so much more. It’s helpful to know that the more consistent you can keep your sleep schedule when you can and the fewer nights you cut your sleep short, the better your body will feel in the short and long run.

For Jennifer Ashton, MD, the chief medical correspondent of ABC News, a consistent sleep-wake schedule wasn’t a problem; it was the duration of slumber that had fallen short for her in the previous few years.

Dr. Ashton suspected she’d thrive on getting more than the seven-ish hours she was currently logging with her early wake-up times for Good Morning America. “I was curious to know whether trying to get that extra thirty minutes to an hour back would make any difference in my energy, appetite, workouts, or mental acuity,” she wrote in her book The Self-Care Solution: A Year of Becoming Happier, Healthier, and Fitter — One Month at a Time.

RELATED: What Is Self-Care and Why Is It So Important for Your Health?

One thing that helped Ashton determine how much sleep she should get was Sleep Cycle, an app that uses sound and movement to track how much you sleep at night. With the data it provided, she was able to connect the dots on how much sleep she got at night and how she felt the next day. Ashton noticed that when she got at least eight hours of sleep, she was “noticeably more energetic” than with her normal seven hours.

After a month of trying to make those daily eight hours of sleep a priority, Ashton reaped big rewards, she says: “I was more productive, efficient, effective, and — a new adjective for the month — noticeably happier. With more sleep, I felt better about myself and life at large,” she wrote.

7 Tips for Optimizing Your Sleep Schedule

You know you should stay off your phone before bed and not eat too close to bedtime. But what can you do to specifically figure out the length and timing of sleep that works best for your body? What cues should you pay attention to from your body? Here’s what Anders and Dr. Dimitriu say.

1. Give Yourself 8 Hours

No matter when you set your wake and bedtime, allow an eight-hour window for sleep, says Dimitriu. You may end up getting less (and you will likely spend some time falling asleep) but make sure the opportunity to sleep is there.

2. Set Your Bedtime by Your Wake Time

Look at what time you need to get up. This time should give you enough time in the morning so you can get ready for your day without feeling rushed and should allow you to get to work or school on time. From there, count backward eight hours, and boom, that’s your ideal bedtime, says Dimitriu.

3. Find What’s Right for Your Body and Your Schedule

Notice how there’s no guideline that you must go to bed at 10 p.m.? “Everyone has a different natural rhythm, and it’s partly hereditary,” says Anders. Some people are night owls and prefer a later bedtime, and there are those who are larks who feel more energized waking up before or with the sunrise, and therefore tend to hit the hay earlier.

That said, your professional, educational, or family responsibilities may not fit in line with your biological clock. If you tend to go to bed late (say, 1 or 2 a.m.) and that’s preventing you from getting the sleep you need because you have to be awake at 7 a.m. to start your job, you need to shift your circadian rhythm back so that you can go to bed earlier, says Anders.

Limit the amount of blue light (emitted from electronic devices) you get within two to three hours of bedtime. If that’s not possible, at least wear blue-blocking glasses, she says. Electronic devices tend to keep you awake for other reasons (work or the content you’re consuming may be alerting), so it’s still preferable to work on a screen-reducing strategy.

4. Beat the Clock

Even when Ashton was busy with social or work events, she’d make sure that those things fit around her sleep schedule — not the other way around. This helped her stick to her commitment to get more sleep while not feeling like she was missing out on anything.

“I knew that if I wanted to keep sleeping for eight hours, I had to focus on continuing to go to bed earlier rather than trying to sleep later the next day. With GMA, I can’t really mess around with my wake-up time: It’s usually 5 a.m. or 5:20 a.m. at the latest, although it can be as early as 4:20 a.m.,” says Ashton. As a result, she knew that for eight hours of sleep, she had to be in bed between 9 and 9:30 p.m.

As a result, when out with friends, Ashton says she’d leave at a reasonable time and then get ready for bed as soon as she got home. If she was finishing work or other projects, she’d challenge herself to stay focused and work with efficiency to finish up before bedtime.

5. Keep Your Routine Intact on the Weekends

Saturday and Sunday are not the days to sleep in two or three hours — that can throw off your sleep routine. Come Sunday night, you won’t be tired for your normally appointed bedtime.

A half hour of sleep-in time on days off is reasonable, says Dimitriu.

6. Brush Your Teeth Early in the Evening

Consider this one a small hack that helps you avoid late night snacking. “Late night snacking keeps you up,” says Dimitriu. Not only can certain foods cause heartburn or contain caffeine that keeps you awake (like chocolate), but eating before bed can be taxing on your digestive system, which diminishes sleep quality, too.

7. Cut Yourself Off From Caffeine by Noon

You may have heard this unofficial rule before, but do you know why? Caffeine has a “half-life” of four to six hours, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). That’s how much time it takes for your body to metabolize half the caffeine. So, for some people, if they drink 20 ounces of coffee at noon, by 6 p.m., it’s as if 10 ounces is still in their system, says Dimitriu. While many people can drink coffee at night and have no problem, for most of us, having coffee in the later afternoon will cut into our sleep — and throw off this all-important sleep routine.";"(2019-12-13)

# Number 10 used apocalyptic Covid-19 graphs to 'frighten' public into lockdown, top statistician

Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter suggested Number 10 'frightened' the public into complying with lockdown rules

Number 10 cherry-picked 'spurious' coronavirus data to justify England's second lockdown and may have intended to frightened the public, according to one of Britain's top experts.

Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter said ministers had 'broken pretty much every code of conduct' by choosing only to show worst-case scenarios, which were often based on out of date data.

The Cambridge professor told MPs today: 'I don't want to ascribe motivation to anyone of course. But if someone was really trying to manipulate the audience and frighten them and persuade them that what was being done was correct, rather than genuinely inform them, then this is the kind of thing they might do.'

Doom-mongering graphs which predicted 50,000 cases by mid-October and 4,000 deaths a day by late November were used by Downing Street to justify England's second lockdown.

Those fantastical charts were widely ridiculed because the country was recording 14,000 daily infections last month and daily deaths currently average 441.

Speaking at a House of Commons select committee today, Professor Spiegelhalter added: 'Those projections were made by one team early in October under certain very pessimistic assumptions.

'They'd already been revised twice by the time they were shown to the public so it was completely inappropriate to present them to the public.

'I'm not saying the judgment [to decide to go into lockdown] was wrong, I'm not making any comment about that.

'What I'm objecting to strongly is the fact such spurious data and graphs were being presented to the public as a justification for the decisions that were being made.

'You didn't need that graph, you just needed quite short-term projections to tell something needed to be done or we could be in real trouble very quickly.

'There is good data available and yet at some point the need to persuade people, to instill a certain emotional reaction in people seems to take over at really quite a high level of decision making. I think it's quite unfortunate.'

Even Tory MPs compared the doomsday data used to justify the second lockdown to the controversial dossier that sent Britain to war with Iraq.

A graph projecting deaths hitting 4,000 per day by the end of December (blue line) was wheeled out at a Downing Street press conference last month announcing the second lockdown

The 4,000 deaths per day scenario was based on the assumption that there would be 1,000 per day by the start of November. There are on average 441 occurring across the UK as of November 23

The statistician was giving evidence to the House of Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee today.

He told MPs: 'I'm on record as having complained about what I call ""the number theatre"" of briefings in which big numbers were being thrown out, which seemed to be intended to give an effect favourable to politicians rather than genuinely trying to inform the public, who are sacrificing so much over this whole period.

'So just to come back to the important issue of trust… trustworthiness is the first pillar of the code of practice of statistics in this country.'

Professor Spiegelhalter was asked about the use of graphs and data in the hastily organised Downing Street press conference last month to announce the second lockdown.

Covid deaths rose steadily in November to take all-cause fatalities 19% above average – but the number is well below England's spring first wave which saw 21,000 people dying each week Covid deaths in England continued to rise in mid-November to 2,274 in the second week of the month, meaning deaths from all causes were 19 per cent higher than usual for the time of year. Office for National Statistics data published today shows there were 1,833 excess deaths in the week that ended November 13, with a total of 11,495 people dying. Although higher than average, the figure is only just over half the 21,157 deaths from all causes in England's worst week in April during the peak of the first wave — when Covid claimed around 8,000 lives. The number of people dying with the viral infection is now on par with those succumbing to flu or pneumonia for the first time since June. The coronavirus deaths recorded in the week that ended November 13 were a rise of 503 on the 1,771 recorded in the first week of the month. The data won't take into account any effects of lockdown because it can take infected patients several weeks to fall severely ill. Figures show that numbers of people dying of any cause is higher than average in all regions, with the northern parts of England still worst hit by Covid. In the North West, deaths are 38 per cent higher than usual, while in the South East they are only marginally higher at two per cent. Hospitals, care homes and private homes are all seeing more fatalities than they would expect to at this time of year, and one in five deaths are now linked to Covid-19, compared to one in six a week earlier. But the ONS data is backdated and known to be too old to reflect the current situation in the country. Department of Health death counts, which take in daily totals from hospitals and care homes for the whole UK, suggest that the number of people being killed by Covid-19 has started to level off after a surge in October. In the last three weeks of October, from the 10th to the 31st, the average number of people dying with coronavirus each day soared four-fold from 63 to 259, while in the first three weeks of November it rose far more slowly – by 57 per cent from 260 to 409. There are signs of a flattening in the trend, although experts have warned deaths will likely stay in the hundreds per day for weeks to come as the effects of huge numbers of infections in October and early November continue to trickle through.

He added: 'The communication on that Saturday was particularly poor, they were rushed into the briefing because somebody had leaked the main graph to the BBC the day before.

'This graph which claimed a projection of up to 4,000 deaths a day was widely ridiculed, and quite rightly.

'That was never intended for public communications it was out of date even at the time when it was released. It just shouldn't have been shown.

'I think what this shows is a real problem we've seen throughout the pandemic of the use of reasonable ""worst-case scenarios"" for public communication.'

Scientists modelling the pandemic to inform the Government produce three forecasts to give ministers a clearer idea of how the virus is spreading.

They use a best-case scenario and a worst-case scenario. Experts then take an average of the two to produce the third forecast.

Professor Spiegelhalter added: 'There is a role for those [worst-case scenario forecasts] – essentially for planning, how many body bags to buy etcetera – but three times I can think of [when they were misused].

'At the beginning we were told up to 500,000 deaths could occur, yeah, okay, if we did absolutely nothing.

'Then we had that graph, the famous one where cases were going to double every week and we'd end up with 49,000 by the end of October. In fact we had 14,000 by the end of October reported.

'That is not trustworthy communications, these are based on extreme assumptions that we just don't do anything.

'I don't want to ascribe motivation to anyone of course but if someone were really trying to manipulate the audience and frighten them and persuade them that what was being done was correct, rather than genuinely inform them, then this is the kind of thing they might do.

'Because no matter what you say about scenarios they will be interpreted as predictions.'

He said: 'Scenarios are fine, but when they're used in proper planning you have multiple scenarios you don't just produce one, you don't just produce the worst possible one, you show people the reasonable ones, optimistic ones, pessimistic ones, so you get an idea of the fan of possibilities and what sort of decisions might lead us into those different scenarios.

'And to just choose one to show it to people it breaks pretty much all the rules that I laid out earlier on.'

The data row comes as Royal Society scientists warned the UK does not have enough access to real-time statistics and by default relies on out of date figures.

The Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics (DELVE) said the Government should make better use of data gathered by private companies, as is done in other countries, rather than sticking with its centralised data gathering approach.

The report, Data Readiness: lessons from an Emergency, highlights how data such as aggregated and anonymised mobility and payment transaction data could be used to give a more accurate picture of the pandemic at national and local levels.

That could in turn lead to improvements in evaluation and better targeting of intervention, the group says, rather than crude approaches.

During the pandemic, counts of the daily flow of people from one place to another between more than 3,000 districts in Spain have been available at the click of a button.

This was based on a collaboration between the country's three main mobile phone operators.

It has allowed Spanish officials to have a deeper understanding how the movement of people contributes to the spread of the virus, DELVE claim.

Spain is one of the few European nations which avoided a second national lockdown, though transmission of the disease is still high.

Neil Lawrence, professor of machine learning at the University of Cambridge and an author of the report said: 'The UK has talked about making better use of data for the public good, but we have had statements of good intent, rather than action.

'We need to plan better for national emergencies. We need to look at the National Risk Register through the lens of what data would help us to respond more effectively.

'We have to learn our lessons from experiences in this pandemic and be better prepared for future crises. That means doing the work now to ensure that companies, the public sector and researchers have pathfinder projects up and running to share and analyse data and help the government to make better informed decisions.'

Professor Lawrence added: 'Mobile phone companies might provide a huge amount of anonymised and aggregated data that would allow us a much greater understanding of how people move around, potentially spreading the virus as they go.

'And there is a wealth of other data, such as from transport systems. The more we understand about this pandemic, the better we can tackle it.

'We should be able to work together, the private and the public sectors, to harness big data for massive positive social good and do that safely and responsibly.'";"(2020-05-21)

# FDA Watch: Monoclonal Antibody Treatments for COVID-19, Preventive Flu Medication, and an Anti-Nightmare Device Get Go-Ahead

FDA greenlights monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID-19. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been testing the safety and efficacy of using monoclonal antibodies to treat the novel coronavirus. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful antigens such as viruses.

On November 9, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab (made by Eli Lilly and Company) for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adult and pediatric patients. The FDA wrote that the most important evidence that bamlanivimab may be effective came from a study showing hospitalizations and emergency room visits occurred in 3 percent of bamlanivimab-treated patients on average compared with 10 percent in placebo-treated patients.

On November 21, the agency granted EUA to a monoclonal antibody combo of casirivimab and imdevimab to be administered together as a treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and children over the age of 12. Clinical trials found that these drugs (produced by Regeneron) taken together in an IV cocktail reduced hospitalization or emergency room visits related to COVID-19 in patients at high risk for disease progression within 28 days after treatment when compared with placebo. Patients received the duo of drugs within three days of testing positive.

COVID-19 home test gets the okay. The Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit has been authorized for emergency use for people who want to test themselves for the coronavirus at home. You collect a sample on a nasal swab, swirl it in a vial, then place the vial in the test unit. In 30 minutes or less, the results can be read directly from the test unit’s light-up display, indicating whether a person is positive or negative. Lucira anticipates its test will cost around $50. The product is not expected to reach the general public until early spring 2021 as the company steps up its manufacturing capabilities.

Flu medication can now be used as a preventive treatment. Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) from Genentech was originally approved in 2018 for treating uncomplicated flu in patients 12 years of age and older who have been exhibiting symptoms for no more than 48 hours. This month, the FDA gave the okay for the medication to be taken as a single-dose preventive treatment for those 12 and older who have been exposed to someone with the flu. “This expanded indication for Xofluza will provide an important option to help prevent influenza just in time for a flu season that is anticipated to be unlike any other because it will coincide with the coronavirus pandemic,” said Debra Birnkrant, MD, the director of the division of antiviral products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

Device to reduce nightmares moves forward. The FDA permitted marketing of a new device intended for the temporary reduction of sleep disturbance related to nightmares in adults 22 years or older who suffer from nightmare disorder or have nightmares from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The device issues a gentle vibration according to indications of heart rate and motion during sleep. The therapeutic tool, called Nightware, works with an Apple Watch and an Apple iPhone.

Drug for rare metabolic disorder gets thumbs-up. The first treatment for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), a rare genetic disorder that mainly affects the kidneys, has gained FDA approval. Developed under the coordination of the Oxalosis & Hyperoxaluria Foundation and the Kidney Health Initiative, the medication Oxlumo (lumasiran) helps decrease the production of oxalate, a substance that is overproduced in patients with PH1. An overabundance of oxalate can lead to progressive kidney damage, kidney failure, and the need for dialysis.

A first direct-to-tumor injection for dogs wins approval. The FDA gave the first approval for an intratumoral injection to treat nonmetastatic mast cell tumors in dogs. Tigilanol tiglate, sold under the brand name Stelfonta, is used to control tumors that most commonly form as nodules or masses under a dog’s skin — in particular areas of a dog’s leg.

FDA approves first treatment to reduce death in diseases that cause premature aging. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and progeroid laminopathies are genetic conditions characterized by the dramatic, rapid appearance of aging beginning in childhood. Most patients die before the age of 15 years from heart failure, heart attack, or stroke. On November 20, the FDA approved Zokinvy (lonafarnib) capsules to reduce the risk of death in patients one year and older who have these devastating conditions. This oral medication helps prevent the buildup of defective progerin or progerin-like protein, which can accumulate and trigger growth impairment.

Food Labeling and Recalls

Manufacturers encouraged to declare sesame as an ingredient. The FDA issued draft guidance this month recommending that food companies voluntarily list sesame on product labels when it is used as a “flavoring” or “spice” or when the common or usual name (such as tahini) does not specify sesame. The guidance is intended to help people who may have an allergic reaction to sesame, such as hives, vomiting, wheezing, or anaphylaxis (a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction). “Many Americans are allergic or sensitive to sesame, and they need the ability to quickly identify products that might contain sesame,” said Susan Mayne, PhD, the director of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, in a statement.

Allergy alert issued for Whole Foods popcorn chicken. Whole Foods Market is voluntarily recalling packaged popcorn chicken from 26 stores in Northern California and Nevada because the product may contain shrimp that was not listed on the product label. People who are allergic to shellfish could have a serious reaction if they consume the product. The item was labeled as “Popcorn Chicken Shaker with Sweet Chili,” with sell-by dates through November 27, 2020.

Romaine recalled. On November 21, Dole Fresh Vegetables Inc. voluntarily issued a recall of a limited number of cases of organic romaine hearts due to a possible E. coli bacteria risk. The specific products are Dole Organic Romaine Hearts (dated October 23 and 26) in a package of three with combined English/French labeling, and Wild Harvest Organic Romaine Hearts with the same dates.

Earlier in the month romaine from Tanimura & Antle (package date October 15 or 16) was also voluntarily recalled because of potential E. coli contamination.

Fresh Express also recalled a limited number of expired cases of Fresh Express Kit Caesar Supreme with the use-by date of November 8, 2020.

Dog food may pose salmonella risk. The health agency listed a voluntary recall on November 13 of 67 cases of Chicken Recipe for Dogs from Albright Raw Dog Food of Fort Wayne, Indiana, because the product may be contaminated with the bacteria salmonella.

Drug Recalls

Popular diabetes medication pulled due to potential carcinogenic impurity. At the beginning of the month, Nostrum Laboratories voluntarily removed from sale two lots of Metformin HCl Extended Release Tablets, USP 500 milligrams (mg), and two lots of Metformin HCl Extended Release Tablets, USP 750 mg. These batches of the widely used type 2 diabetes medication may contain excessive amounts of a cancer-causing compound called nitrosamine.

Prescription mouthwash may have bacterial contamination. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP, a prescription germicidal mouthwash used as part of professional programs to treat gingivitis, has been voluntarily recalled by its manufacturer Lohxa due to concerns that it may be contaminated with the bacteria Burkholderia lata.

# Anxiety Associated With Faster Alzheimer’s Disease Onset

Summary: Anxiety may accelerate the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. Brain scans revealed patients who progressed from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease had decreased volume in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

Source: RSNA

Anxiety is associated with an increased rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study being presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Alzheimer’s disease represents a major public health crisis worldwide. The number of deaths from the disease has more than doubled since 2000, and it is currently the fifth-leading cause of death among individuals over 65 in the U.S.

Many people with Alzheimer’s disease first suffer from mild cognitive impairment, a decline in cognitive abilities like memory and thinking skills that is more rapid than normally associated with aging. Anxiety has been frequently observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment, although its role in disease progression is not well understood.

“We know that volume loss in certain areas of the brain is a factor that predicts progression to Alzheimer’s disease,” said study senior author Maria Vittoria Spampinato, M.D., professor of radiology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston. “In this study, we wanted to see if anxiety had an effect on brain structure, or if the effect of anxiety was independent from brain structure in favoring the progression of disease.”

The study group included 339 patients, average age of 72 years, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 cohort. Each person had a baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment; 72 progressed to Alzheimer’s disease while 267 remained stable.

The researchers obtained brain MRIs to determine the baseline volumes of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, two areas important to forming memories. They also tested for the presence of the ApoE4 allele, the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Anxiety was measured with established clinical surveys.

As expected, patients who progressed to Alzheimer’s disease had significantly lower volumes in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex and greater frequency of the ApoE4 allele. Most notably though, the researchers found that anxiety was independently associated with cognitive decline.

“Mild cognitive impairment patients with anxiety symptoms developed Alzheimer’s disease faster than individuals without anxiety, independently of whether they had a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease or brain volume loss,” said study first author Jenny L. Ulber, a medical student at MUSC.

The link between anxiety symptoms and a faster progression to Alzheimer’s disease presents an opportunity for improving the screening and management of patients with early mild cognitive impairment, the researchers said.

“We need to better understand the association between anxiety disorders and cognitive decline,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We don’t know yet if the anxiety is a symptom–in other words, their memory is getting worse and they become anxious–or if anxiety contributes to cognitive decline. If we were able in the future to find that anxiety is actually causing progression, then we should more aggressively screen for anxiety disorders in the elderly.”

“The geriatric population is routinely screened for depression in many hospitals, but perhaps this vulnerable population should also be assessed for anxiety disorders,” Ulber added. “Middle-aged and elderly individuals with high level of anxiety may benefit from intervention, whether it be pharmacological or cognitive behavioral therapy, with the goal of slowing cognitive decline.”

The study was based on MRI scans done at one point in time. For future research, the team would like to study MRIs obtained after the initial scan to better understand the connection between anxiety and brain structure.

“We’re now interested in looking at changes over time to see if anxiety has an effect one way or the other on how fast the brain damage progresses,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We will also take a closer look at gender differences in the association between anxiety and cognitive decline.”

# The first COVID-19 vaccines won’t end the U.S. crisis right away

Don’t even think of putting your mask away anytime soon.

Despite the expected arrival of the first COVID-19 vaccines in just a few weeks, it could take several months — probably well into 2021 — before things get back to something close to normal in the U.S. and Americans can once again go to the movies, cheer at an NBA game or give Grandma a hug.

The first, limited shipments of the vaccine would mark just the beginning of what could be a long and messy road toward the end of the pandemic that has upended life and killed more than a quarter-million people in the U.S. In the meantime, Americans are being warned not to let their guard down.

“If you’re fighting a battle and the cavalry is on the way, you don’t stop shooting; you keep going until the cavalry gets here, and then you might even want to continue fighting,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said last week.

This week, AstraZeneca became the third vaccine maker to say early data indicates its shots are highly effective. Pfizer last week asked the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization to begin distributing its vaccine, and Moderna is expected to do the same any day. Federal officials say the first doses will ship within a day of authorization.

But most people will probably have to wait months for shots to become widely available. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines also both require two doses, meaning people will have to go back for a second shot after three and four weeks, respectively, to get the full protection.

Moncef Slaoui, head of the U.S. vaccine development effort, said on CNN on Sunday that early data on the Pfizer and Moderna shots suggest about 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity — a milestone he said is likely to be reached in May.

But along the way, experts say the logistical challenges of the biggest vaccination campaign in U.S. history and public fear and misinformation could hinder the effort and kick the end of the pandemic further down the road.

“It’s going to be a slow process and it’s going to be a process with ups and downs, like we’ve seen already,” said Dr. Bill Moss, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University.

Once federal officials give a vaccine the go-ahead, doses that are already being stockpiled will be deployed with the goal of “putting needles in people’s arms” within 24 to 48 hours, said Paul Mango, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official involved in the Operation Warp Speed effort to develop COVID-19 vaccines.

Those first shipments are expected to be limited and will be directed to high-risk groups at designated locations, such as frontline healthcare workers at hospitals.

Federal and state officials are still figuring out exactly how to prioritize those most at risk, including the elderly, prison inmates and homeless people. By the end of January, HHS officials say, all senior citizens should be able to get shots, assuming a vaccine becomes available by the end of 2020.

For everyone else, they expect widespread availability of vaccines would start a couple of months later.

To make shots easily accessible, state and federal officials are enlisting a vast network of providers, such as pharmacies and doctor’s offices.

But some worry long lines won’t be the problem.

“One of the things that may be a factor that hasn’t been discussed that much is: How many will be willing to be vaccinated?” said Christine Finley, director of Vermont’s immunization program. She noted that the accelerated development of the vaccine and the politics around it have fueled worries about safety.

Even if the first vaccines prove as effective as suggested by early data, they won’t have much impact if enough people don’t get them.

Vaccines aren’t always effective in everyone: Over the past decade, for example, seasonal flu vaccines have been effective in from 20% to 60% of people who get them.

AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna say early trial data suggests their vaccine candidates are about 90% or more effective. But those rates could change by the time the studies end.

Also, the definition of “effective” can vary.

Rather than prevent infection entirely, the first COVID-19 vaccines might only prevent illness. Vaccinated people might still be able to contract and transmit the virus, another reason experts say masks will remain crucial for some time.

Another important aspect of vaccines: They can take awhile to work.

The first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine might bring about a degree of protection within a couple of weeks, meaning people who get infected might not get as sick as they otherwise would. But full protection could take up to two weeks after the second shot — or about six weeks after the first shot, said Deborah Fuller, a vaccine expert at the University of Washington.

People who don’t understand that lag could mistakenly think the vaccine made them sick if they happen to come down with COVID-19 soon after a shot. People might also blame the vaccine for unrelated health problems and amplify those fears online.

“All you need is a few people getting on social media,” Moss said.

There’s also the possibility of real side effects. COVID-19 vaccine trials have to include at least 30,000 people, but the chances of a rare side effect turning up are more likely as growing numbers of people are vaccinated.

Even if a link between the vaccine and a possible side effect seems likely, distribution of the shots might not be halted if the risk is deemed small and is outweighed by the benefits, said Dr. Wilbur Chen, a vaccine expert at the University of Maryland.

But Chen said public health officials will need to clearly explain the relative risks to avoid public panic.

Depending on whether the virus mutates in coming years and how long the vaccine’s protection lasts, booster shots later on may also be necessary, said Dr. Edward Belongia, a vaccine researcher with the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Wisconsin.

Belongia and many others say the coronavirus won’t ever be stamped out and will become one of the many seasonal viruses that sicken people. How quickly will vaccines help reduce the threat of the virus to that level?

“At this point, we just need to wait and see,” Belongia said.";"(2019-12-13)

# Coronavirus England: Deaths rise 28% in one week to 2,466

Advertisement

Covid deaths in England continued to rise in mid-November to 2,274 in the second week of the month, meaning deaths from all causes were 19 per cent higher than usual for the time of year.

Office for National Statistics data published today shows there were 1,833 excess deaths in the week that ended November 13, with a total of 11,495 people dying.

Although higher than average, the figure is only just over half the 21,157 deaths from all causes in England's worst week in April during the peak of the first wave — when Covid claimed around 8,000 lives.

The number of people dying with the viral infection is now on par with those succumbing to flu or pneumonia for the first time since June.

The coronavirus deaths recorded in the week that ended November 13 were a rise of 503 on the 1,771 recorded in the first week of the month. The data won't take into account any effects of lockdown because it can take infected patients several weeks to fall severely ill.

Figures show that numbers of people dying of any cause is higher than average in all regions, with the northern parts of England still worst hit by Covid. In the North West, deaths are 38 per cent higher than usual, while in the South East they are only marginally higher at two per cent.

Hospitals, care homes and private homes are all seeing more fatalities than they would expect to at this time of year, and one in five deaths are now linked to Covid-19, compared to one in six a week earlier. But the ONS data is backdated and known to be too old to reflect the current situation in the country.

Department of Health death counts, which take in daily totals from hospitals and care homes for the whole UK, suggest that the number of people being killed by Covid-19 has started to level off after a surge in October.

In the last three weeks of October, from the 10th to the 31st, the average number of people dying with coronavirus each day soared four-fold from 63 to 259, while in the first three weeks of November it rose far more slowly – by 57 per cent from 260 to 409.

There are signs of a flattening in the trend, although experts have warned deaths will likely stay in the hundreds per day for weeks to come as the effects of huge numbers of infections in October and early November continue to trickle through.

The deaths recorded in this week's ONS release all happened between November 7 and November 13.

Because it generally takes between two and three weeks for Covid victims to die after they have caught the virus, this means that most of the coronavirus deaths in the updated numbers were people who got infected in the last week of October.

This means the number of people dying was still increasing in this week as a result of the fast-growing numbers of infections the country saw as the second wave spiralled out of control.

The ONS itself estimated that more than 50,000 people were catching the virus every day by the end of last month, with a Government-funded study suggesting the figure could have been as high as 100,000 a day.

Although lockdown appears to have brought this under control – estimates suggest the R rate has fallen noticeably and that daily infections were down to around 39,000 after the first week of lockdown – it will take weeks for this to filter through into the death counts.

Daily case counts were first to fall when the effects of lockdown started to sink in – the average number of new positive tests has fallen from a peak of 25,000 a day nine days ago to 19,500 now.

Hospitalisations will follow suit as fewer infections leads to fewer severe cases, and then deaths will drop as the total numbers of people in hospitals falls.

Although the number of people dying is not surging as fast as it did during the UK's first wave of Covid-19, it still marks the deaths of hundreds of people every day.

Dr Sarah Scobie, research director at the Nuffield Trust health think-tank, said today: 'Despite the end of the second national lockdown in England coming into focus, today’s figures are a sobering reminder of the dreadful impact of this virus.

'For the first time since the end of the first wave, over 2,000 Covid deaths have been registered in a single week.

'We've seen a sharp jump in the number of deaths in hospital in the week ending November 13, with Covid now accounting for a third of patients dying in hospital. Deaths in care homes and private homes are also higher than we'd expect at this time of year.'

Today's ONS update showed that all English regions, and Wales, saw a higher number of registered deaths than the five-year average.

North West England had 615 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in the week ending November 13 – the highest number for the region since the week ending May 15.

LOSS OF TASTE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IN SECOND WAVE A lost sense of taste was the most common symptom among people with coronavirus in England's second wave, Office for National Statistics data suggests. The ONS analysed reports of symptoms among people getting swabbed in its mass testing programme between August and October. Symptoms around the time of the test were considered. It compared how often people with a certain symptom tested positive, and how often people with certain symptoms tested positive for the virus. It found that loss of taste was far more common among positive cases than coughs or fevers, which are seen as the more typical and obvious signs of Covid-19. Between 35 and 45 per cent of people testing positive for coronavirus lost their sense of taste, the ONS found. Its graphs suggested that as many as 45 per cent of people between the ages of 18 and 35 experienced the effect, compared to 30 per cent of older or younger age groups. By comparison, fever was found in around 10-20 per cent of people, and coughing in 10 per cent or fewer. The report said people with symptoms tested positive more often than those without: 'The positivity rates in those with specific symptoms or other evidence of symptoms are higher than those not reporting any evidence of symptoms.' It added in a series of caveats that the symptoms were self-reported and not diagnosed by a doctor, and that they did not include those among people who were in hospitals or care homes.

In Yorkshire and the Humber, 450 Covid-19 deaths were registered in that week, while there were 284 in the West Midlands and 245 in the East Midlands.

Weekly registered deaths not involving Covid-19 were below the five-year average for the third consecutive week, the ONS said.

A total of 68,524 deaths have so far been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, according to the latest reports from the UK’s statistics agencies.

This includes 62,162 deaths in England and Wales up to November 13 which were confirmed by the ONS on Tuesday.

Since these statistics were compiled, a further 2,432 deaths are known to have occurred in England, plus 80 in Scotland, 128 in Wales and 91 in Northern Ireland, according to additional data published on the Government’s coronavirus dashboard.

Together, these totals mean that so far 71,255 deaths involving Covid-19 have taken place in the UK, when figures from the statistical bodies of Scotland and Northern Ireland are also included.

These are deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.

Of all deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales, around two thirds occurred in hospital, (40,062 deaths), the figures show.

The remainder occurred in care homes (16,849 deaths), private homes (2,927 deaths), hospices (833 deaths), other communal establishments (242 deaths) and elsewhere (223 deaths).

More than 30,000 excess deaths not linked to Covid-19 have occurred in private homes since the start of the pandemic.

There were 30,785 non-Covid excess deaths in homes in England and Wales registered between March 7 and November 13, the ONS said.

In a separate report published this morning the ONS revealed that a lost sense of taste was the most common symptom among people with coronavirus in England's second wave.

The ONS analysed reports of symptoms among people getting swabbed in its mass testing programme between August and October.

It compared how often people with a certain symptom tested positive, and how often people with certain symptoms tested positive for the virus.

It found that loss of taste was far more common among positive cases than coughs or fevers, which are seen as the more typical and obvious signs of Covid-19.

# Sitting Raises Women's Odds for Heart Failure

Too much sitting or lying down significantly increases older women's risk of hospitalization for heart failure, even if they get recommended amounts of physical activity, a new study warns.

""These findings are consistent with other studies confirming that people with more daily sedentary time are more likely to develop chronic health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke and premature death from heart disease and other causes,"" said study author Michael LaMonte, a research associate professor of epidemiology at the University at Buffalo in New York.

The researchers analyzed data from nearly 81,000 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 in the Women's Health Initiative Study. None had been diagnosed with heart failure at the start of that study.

During an average follow-up of nine years, just over 1,400 women were hospitalized due to heart failure. Compared with women who spent less than 6.5 hours a day sitting or lying down, the risk of heart failure hospitalization was 15% higher in women who spent 6.6-9.5 hours a day sitting or lying down, and 42% higher in women who spent more than 9.5 hours a day sitting or lying down.

Compared with women who sat less than 4.5 hours a day, the risk of heart failure hospitalization was 14% higher in those who sat between 4.6 and 8.5 hours a day, and 54% higher in those who sat more than 8.5 hours a day.

An important finding was that the link between more sitting and lying down and a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization was seen even in women who were the most active and did suggested amounts of exercise.

The study was published Nov. 24 in the journal Circulation: Heart Failure.

""For heart failure prevention, we need to promote taking frequent breaks from prolonged sitting or lying down, in addition to trying to achieve guideline levels of physical activity, such as those recommended by the American Heart Association,"" LaMonte said in a journal news release.

# COVID Vaccine Might Spur Some Sickness

By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter

TUESDAY, Nov. 24, 2020 – At least three new COVID-19 vaccine candidates are already in the pipeline, will a roll-out expected early in the new year. But on Monday, experts attending a meeting of an advisory committee to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stressed that Americans who get a shot shouldn't be surprised if they feel under the weather for a few days afterwards.

""These are immune responses, so if you feel something after vaccination, you should expect to feel that. And when you do, it's normal that you have some arm soreness or some fatigue or some body aches or even some fever,"" Patricia Stinchfield of Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, told the meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. She represents the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, and said providers must be ready to explain this to people who line up to get any COVID-19 vaccine.

Vaccines work to fight disease by producing an immune response within the body. And sometimes that means flu-like symptoms, such as aches, headache and fever.

Already, some volunteers in trials of candidate vaccines from drug companies Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca have reported flu-like symptoms after immunization. And experts worry that those reports might keep people away from vaccination, or from required second doses.

The CDC's Dr. Sara Oliver told the committee during the five-hour-long meeting that, depending on the survey, anywhere between 40% and 80% of Americans say they'd be willing to get vaccinated.

Dr. Paul Hunter, of the city of Milwaukee health department and a voting member of the committee, said the testimonials of the first batches of people who get a COVID-19 vaccine could be crucial to wider acceptance.

""The people who highly value getting the vaccine soon and fast, early, are going to be really helpful to everyone else. And I think we really are going to need to honor them, because they are going to let us know how it feels,"" he told the committee. ""And I think these people are likely to be health care workers who are likely to be up for that kind of task.""

Another vaccine candidate

Americans were greeted with a possible advance against coronavirus as Thanksgiving week began: A third vaccine candidate shows good results in shielding recipients against the virus.

Meanwhile, U.S. coronavirus cases continued to explode: More than 179,000 new cases were recorded on Monday, with more than 12.4 million Americans now known to be infected.

Hopes for the roll-out of another effective vaccine brightened on Monday, however. Drug giant AstraZeneca announcing that late-stage clinical trials of its coronavirus shot showed it to be 70.4% effective, The New York Times reported.

The trials were conducted in the United Kingdom and Brazil in collaboration with the University of Oxford. The AstraZeneca vaccine becomes the third shot to show good effectiveness, following on the heels of promising data on vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. Both of the latter two shots had effectiveness around 95%.

The AstraZeneca results were based on the results of two dosing regimens for the vaccine: One regimen showed an effectiveness of 62%, the company said, while the other showed a 90% effectiveness.

The regimen showing a 90% effectiveness involved a first dose given at half strength and a second dose given at standard strength. No severe cases of COVID-19 emerged among any recipients, and there was a reduction in asymptomatic infections, suggesting that the vaccine was reducing transmission of the virus, AstraZeneca said.

Worsening spread

In the meantime, the new coronavirus is spreading across America with unprecedented speed, the White House Coronavirus Task Force said in its first briefing in four months on Thursday.

""This is more cases, more rapidly, than what we had seen before,"" Dr. Deborah Birx said during the briefing. ""You can see the increase in test positivity to around 10%."" That's the number of people tested who get a positive diagnosis.

# A Real Guy Offers Advice on How to Beat ED

When Jimmy Williams got married a few years back, he wanted what every guy wants: to spend quality time between the sheets with his new wife. But Williams, 61, who hails from Staten Island, NY, had erectile dysfunction, or ED. The problem had been developing for the previous three to four years as a side effect from having diabetes. His relationship gave him an urgent reason to finally address it.

“I was trying to perform with my wife, and I didn’t want us to have a bad experience,” he says.

Sound familiar? If so, you’re far from alone. According to the American Urological Association, ED is the most common sex problem that men talk about with their doctors. But while an estimated 30 million American men have erectile dysfunction, few openly discuss their experiences with other guys. That’s why Williams is being so frank now. He wants to share what happened to him, and explain how treatment for ED changed his life—and maybe even saved his new marriage.

Many Guys Suffer Silently With ED

So, what is ED, exactly? It’s not the occasional failure to launch caused by stress, too much to drink that night, or a host of other temporary roadblocks to erections. That’s normal, if frustrating. ED, on the other hand, spoils the party on a regular basis. When you’re ready for sex, you have trouble getting or maintaining a sufficient erection.

That’s what was happening to Williams.

“I was at a desperate point,” Williams admits now. “I was disheartened, I didn’t have confidence, and there was a hopelessness about achieving sexual activity with my wife.”

An appointment with a urologist for an unrelated bladder problem led to his ED diagnosis. The doctor asked him about his sex life.

“I ask all my patients in Jimmy’s age range how things are going down there,” says Williams’s doctor, urologist Miguel A. Pineda, M.D., director of Male Sexual Dysfunction and Urologic Prosthetics at Staten Island University Hospital. “When I learned that Jimmy had ED, I said this is something that I can help you with, and we just jumped right in.”

It helps to have a doctor who raises the topic like that, but if your doc doesn’t, it’s up to you. That can be hard for a lot of guys who feel uncomfortable talking about what happens in the bedroom. Maybe this will help encourage you: There are many effective options exist to help you get your groove back—you've just got to ask.

“When guys learn that, the room kind of lightens,” says urologist Bob Berookhim, M.D., director of Male Fertility and Microsurgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. “The guy perks up and is much more willing to have a conversation about it.”

What Can Get in the Way of a Guy “Getting It Up”?

Why does ED happen? It will help to first understand the basics of how erections work.

When you get turned on, your brain sends signals that trigger an increase of blood flow below your belt.

Two chambers in your penis—called the corpus cavernosum—relax.

The spongy tissue inside those chambers fills with blood and holds it there, causing you to become erect, ideally until you have an orgasm.

Many things can get in the way, says Jamin Brahmbhatt, M.D., a urologist at Orlando Health in Orlando, FL. Anxiety and depression, for starters, as well as some of the drugs that treat those conditions, can compromise your ability to get and stay hard. Stress is a common cause, too. Like anxiety and depression, stress interrupts your brain’s messaging system, so sufficient blood does not make it to your penis. Stress is particularly prevalent right now. “I’ve seen an uptick in men with sexual dysfunction during the COVID pandemic,"" Dr. Brahmbhatt says. ""It’s caused by a psychological impact on their sexual function.”

Who Gets ED, and How Does a Guy Get It Diagnosed?

If you’re a younger man, say in your 30s, such psychological issues likely will be among the first causes your doctor will investigate. Your doctor also may check your testosterone levels to determine whether a hormone imbalance is to blame. Though low testosterone itself rarely causes ED on its own, it can dampen your desire for sex, and that can make getting an erection difficult.

ED also can be a side effect of medications, including some that treat high blood pressure, depression, and anxiety. Once you get off the medication causing the problem, normal erections generally return right away, if the medication was the only factor. Here are a few examples of drugs that may affect your ability to get an erection.

Blood pressure medications that can cause ED include:

Aldomet (methyldopa)

Catapres (clonidine)

Lopressor (metoprolol)

Tenormin (atenolol)

Antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs that can cause ED include:

Cymbalta (duloxetine)

Paxil (paroxetine)

Prozac (fluoxetine)

Valium (diazepam)

Xanax (alprazolam)

Erectile dysfunction can also be a consequence, often temporary, of surgical treatment for prostate cancer or an enlarged prostate. Prostate surgery can take several weeks to several months to recover from. For some men who have surgery for prostate cancer, nerves that help control erections will have to be removed along with the prostate. To regain the ability to have an erection, such men may require a penile implant (more on that in a moment).

But at Williams’s age and older, other causes become more common. Heart disease and diabetes often accompany ED because they damage the small and fragile blood vessels that supply blood to your penis. In fact, as many as 85% of men with diabetes have erection troubles.

“When we see older men with ED, we think heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking,” says Dr. Berookhim.

Dr. Pineda agrees. When he sees a man whom he expects has ED due to blood vessel damage, he’ll treat him for ED but also refer him to a cardiologist to have his heart health evaluated.

But the heart-erection connection isn't just an age issue, Dr. Brahmbhatt says. When ED occurs in younger men, especially those who are obese, it may also indicate future heart problems. “It’s important we get young men to discuss their ED at an early age because it can often be a warning sign for silent heart conditions,” he adds. That means that you may be developing heart disease but have no other symptoms yet.

What Can a Guy Expect From ED Treatments?

If your doctor discovers that your ED is caused by a medication you’re taking, solving your problem may be as simple as switching to a different drug, if possible. Psychological counseling can ease depression and anxiety, if either is what’s causing your ED.

Lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, exercise, and a nutritious diet, can help prevent or limit damage to your blood vessels and may protect your ability to have an erection. But if that damage has already occurred, says Dr. Pineda, lifestyle improvements may keep ED from getting worse, but it won’t repair the damage itself. You will likely need treatment, possibly one of these options:

Pills

Oral medications that boost blood flow to the penis are often the first-line defense for treating ED. They belong to a class of drugs called PDE5 inhibitors. You may recognize the name Viagra (sildenafil) as the best-known of the lot, but other pills do pretty much the same thing. They are Cialis (tadalafil), Levitra (vardenafil) and Stendra (avanafil). While they tend to do the job of increasing blood flow well, these drugs don’t allow for a lot of sexual spontaneity. You may have to wait as long as an hour for them to take effect. And you can only use them every 48 hours.

You may also experience side effects, like headaches, which was one reason Williams stopped using them. Muscle aches may also occur. And they should not be taken if you’re already on nitrates for heart disease—taken together, this combo may suddenly lower your blood pressure and cause you to faint.

Also, for some men, they don’t work well enough, Dr. Pineda says. “They may get you an erection that’s sufficient for penetration, but their penis remains half soft so sex is not that pleasurable,” he explains.

Another potential downside? Dr. Pineda also says that even if the meds work well now, they might not work forever. If the blood vessels that supply blood to your penis continue to deteriorate (due to diabetes or heart disease, for instance), you may need to try another option. With his diabetes, that’s the direction Williams was heading.

Injections

These are for men who find PDE5 inhibitors ineffective or don’t like the side effects. Williams tried them as an alternative to pills. The most commonly injected drug is called Caverject Impulse (alprostadil). Like the pills, it works by increasing blood flow to the penis. However, injections—which go directly into your penis—act much more quickly than pills (which are taken by mouth, and must be first digested and absorbed into the bloodstream). After a shot, you should have an erection in under 20 minutes, according to Dr. Pineda, possibly as quickly as five minutes.

However, you may not love the idea of injecting your penis. That’s understandable. Still, the needle is small and thin, and the drug is very effective. The American Urological Association estimates that it enables erections in 85% of men who use it.

The side effects can include pain and scarring at the injection site. Your erection should last about 30 minutes or until you orgasm. If it doesn’t go away after two to four hours, Dr. Pineda advises that you head to the emergency room. Why? Because long-lasting erections can cause damage that may make your ED untreatable.

Williams did not take injections for long. He felt throbbing at the injection site, which Dr. Pineda says is not common.

Another drug, called Muse (alprostadil), is used for injections, but it also comes as a tiny suppository, which is inserted into the head of your penis. It goes to work as it dissolves. More appealing, perhaps, than an injection, but research shows that it may not be as effective.

Vacuum Devices

This tube-shaped tool fits over your penis with an air-tight seal. Negative pressure draws blood into your penis to give you an erection, and then an elastic band is fitted to the base of your penis to hold the blood in. That keeps you erect. While effective, Dr. Pineda says that these devices are cumbersome and can be uncomfortable. The advantage? No medication or surgery needed. Williams says he skipped this option altogether—it just wasn’t for him.

Implants

Speaking of surgery, the final option for ED is a penile prosthetic implant. These are for men who have exhausted other treatment options. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the most commonly used implant consists of three parts. Surgery requires a general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia, which prevents pain in your lower body, and will take about an hour.

During the procedure, your doctor will make an incision in one of three places: just below the head of your penis, at the base of your penis, or in the lower part of your abdomen. Two inflatable cylinders are then implanted inside your penis. They will serve the same purpose as your corpora cavernosa, the spongy cylinders that normally fill with blood as you become erect.

Your surgeon will also implant a fluid-filled pouch near your bladder. This will connect to the two artificial cylinders as well as to the third part of your prosthetic, a pump which is placed inside your scrotum. When you want to have an erection, you squeeze and release the pump until the cylinders have filled with fluid. In under two minutes, you have an erection.

“You can be very spontaneous when you can get an erection that fast,” says Dr. Pineda.

In the end, Williams opted for one of these. He admits that he was apprehensive at first. The idea of surgery down there gave him pause. But after a few discussions with Dr. Pineda, he gave it the green light.

Now, he couldn’t be happier. “It does the job better than a real penis,” he says. “You don’t realize there’s something inflatable in there. It’s that realistic to me.”

Dr. Pineda says that implants in no way lessen the pleasure of sex. He also offers another advantage: You can go all night. When you inflate it, it stays inflated, even after you ejaculate. Williams concurs.

“I’m not trying to make light of it, but it’s like the Energizer Bunny,” Williams enthuses. “You can go on and on and on until you deflate it yourself. You have that option. It’s given me a new lease on life.”";"(2019-12-13)

# Doctors urge the CDC to warn Americans about coronavirus vaccine side effects

U.S. doctors are worried that their patients won't return to get a second dose of coronavirus vaccine if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) doesn't give them a clear, upfront warning that none of the shots will be a 'walk in the park.'

'As a practicing physician, I have got to be sure my patients will come back for the second dose,' said Dr Sandra Fryhofer of Emory University during a Monday meeting with officials, attended by CNBC.

'We really have got to make patients aware that this is not going to be a walk in the park.'

Participants in trials for vaccines made by Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna have described the side effects of the shots as similar to the symptoms of COVID-19 itself.

On the other hand, convincing Americans - especially some who are high-risk, including black and Latinx people in the U.S. - that COVID-19 vaccines are safe to take has been a challenge to begin with.

Ultimately, it will be up to states to decide how to distribute vaccines to their populations, and who will get them first, HHS Secretary Alex Azar announced Tuesday - and that will include how to talk to their residents about vaccination.

CDC and state officials as well as individual doctors will have to walk a thin line between telling hundreds of millions of Americans what to expect from a coronavirus vaccine and avoiding scaring them off from getting the shots.

Doctors advising the CDC on how to distribute coronavirus vaccines urged official to warn Americans that the shots could leave them with side effects like fatigue, aches and fevers - not unlike the virus itself - while convincing people to get both doses of the shots (file)

Overall, trials for all three shots deemed them safe and 'tolerable,' meaning the risks of their side effects were clearly outweighed by the shots' benefits.

But 'tolerable' does not mean that the shots have no effects.

Like most vaccines, the three COVID-19 jabs come with some soreness and aches at the injection sites and throughout the body.

According to participants in each trial, however, the coronavirus vaccines pack more of a punch than most.

Coronavirus vaccines might leave us laid up for a day with headaches, fevers, sore muscles, shivering chills and no energy, participants in trials for Moderna's and Pfizer's shots told CNBC.

But the side effects will be worth it, and fade after a day, they added.

Vaccines of all kinds commonly come with side effects - some more unpleasant than others.

Luke Hutchinson, 44, volunteered to participate in Moderna's coronavirus vaccine trial. After his second dose of the shot, he developed a fever, aches that left him bedridden for the day and with chills so bad he cracked a tooth while shaking. He told CNBC he wishes he'd had warning, but thinks the shot's protection is worth the discomfort.

His first shot left Hutchinson with just mild side effects, but he compared his symptoms to 'full-on COVID' after the second shot

Luke Hutchinsons, 44, was prepared for that possibility after signing up to help test whether Moderna's shot worked, safely.

He felt a bit less than 100 percent for a few days after the first dose but eight hours after his second dose on September 15, the healthy computational biologist was too weak to leave bed, running a high fever and writhing with pain and shivers.

It even got harder for Hutchinson to breathe. The experimental COVID-19 vaccine left him feeling like he'd contracted the virus it was meant to protect him against.

He wasn't the only one. CNBC spoke to two other participants in the Moderna trial and two enrolled in Pfizer's vaccine trial, all of whom reported intense - but thankfully brief - side effects.

In addition to their side effects, the vaccine testers share the opinion that most people should still get a COVID-19 vaccine, once one has been approved.

Their advice to the vaccine makers echoed that of the doctors on the Monday call: warn people what they are in for after getting their shots.

Vaccines work by tricking the body into thinking it's been infected with the pathogens the shot is designed to protect against.

By doing so, the shot trains the immune system what to look for, so that it's primed and ready to fight off the real danger when we encounter it.

Sarah Hurst, 47, from Goring-on-Thames and Jack Somers, 35, took part in the trials. Ms Hurst said it gave her a 'tiny sense of pride' to have been a volunteer in the trials

But some of the symptoms we experience when we catch a virus, like a cold, or the flu or coronavirus itself are due to that immune response.

This crossover between what it feels like to have a virus and to get a shot that ramps up your immune response as if you have a virus has caused confusion, including the incorrect belief of many who are vaccine hesitant that vaccines, like those against measles or the flu actually 'give' the recipient the respective viruses.

Still others who are vaccine hesitant realize that what they experience after a shot is a reaction, but would rather take the risk of possibly contracting a virus than sign up to knowingly sign up for a known possible 'adverse event.'

Importantly, not all COVID-19 recipients experience these effects.

Nevertheless, how clinicians giving vaccines prepare the recipients to get their shots, which come in two doses, will be crucial, the experts on Monday's call said.

Patsy Stinchfield, a nurse practitioner at Children's Minnesota made the point that the language clinicians use to talk about the shots could make a difference.

She suggested explaining potential aches, pains, fevers and chills as a 'response' to the vaccine, rather than an 'adverse reaction,' according to CNBC.

'These are immune responses, and so if you feel something after vaccination, you should expect to feel that.

'When you do, it's normal to have some arm soreness or fatigue, some body aches and maybe even a fever. It sounds like in some of these trials, maybe even having to stay home from work.'

That was the case for one North Carolina woman who took part in Moderna's trial.

'The first dose is no big deal. And then the second dose will definitely put you down for the day for sure...You will need to take a day off after the second dose,' the woman in her 50s told CNBC this summer.

'If this proves to work, people are going to have to toughen up,' another Moderna trial participant said.

Participants in Pfizer's trial in Australia also claimed they suffered migraines and fevers.

Jack Sommers, a 35-year-old journalist who took part in Oxford's trial in the UK described having a low-grade fever and an achy arm after vaccination, but told Daily Mail Online he was very happy to have participated and felt like a member of a winning team after hearing that the shot he'd helped test worked.";"(2020-04-16)

# Study: Diabetics on Statins More Likely to Die From COVID

Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.1 And, it is clear that people with diabetes have a much higher risk of death within the first week of hospitalization for COVID-19 than people without diabetes.2 However, recent data from two different studies analyzing the association between statin use, diabetes and severity of disease with COVID-19 have found conflicting results.3
Researchers believe there is a relationship between statins, diabetes and an increased risk of severe disease from COVID-19. But there was a relationship between the drug and the health condition that predates the current pandemic.
Statin drugs are one of the most prescribed medications.4 According to a study in JAMA Cardiology, the number of people using statins jumped from 21.8 million in 2002-2003 to 39.2 million in 2012-2013, the most current data available.5 Annual prescriptions rose from 134 million to 221 million during the same time, which represented a 64.9% increase.

In this study of over 3300 patients, we found ZERO ADHD in the unvaccinated group (N=561). We found that using billed office visits was a more powerful test than the weaker odds ratio of incidence. Even after blocking for healthcare exposure/age, family history of autoimmunity, and gender, the associations of many bad health outcomes were robust. Anemia was especially prominent in the vaccinated. Here is our announcement.

The average total incidence of billed office visits per outcome related to the outcomes were compared across groups (Relative Incidence of Office Visit (RIOV)). RIOV is shown to be more powerful than odds ratio of diagnoses. Full cohort, cumulative incidence analyses, matched for days of care, and matched for family history analyses were conducted across quantiles of vaccine uptake. Increased office visits related to many diagnoses were robust to days-of-care-matched analyses, family history, gender block, age block, and false discovery risk. Many outcomes had high RIOV odds ratios after matching for days-of-care (e.g., anemia (6.334), asthma (3.496), allergic rhinitis (6.479), and sinusitis (3.529), all significant under the Z-test). Developmental disorders were determined to be difficult to study due to extremely low prevalence in the practice, potentially attributable to high rates of vaccine cessation upon adverse events and family history of autoimmunity. Remarkably, zero of the 561 unvaccinated patients in the study had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to 0.063% of the (partially and fully) vaccinated. The implications of these results for the net public health effects of whole population vaccination and with respect for informed consent on human health are compelling. Our results give agency to calls for research conducted by individuals who are independent of any funding sources related to the vaccine industry. While the low rates of developmental disorders prevented sufficiently powered hypothesis testing, it is notable that the overall rate of autism spectrum disorder (0.84%) in the cohort is half that of the US national rate (1.69%). The practice-wide rate of ADHD was roughly half of the national rate. The data indicate that unvaccinated children in the practice are not unhealthier than the vaccinated and indeed the overall results may indicate that the unvaccinated pediatric patients in this practice are healthier overall than the vaccinated.";"(2019-12-13)

# Britain records 11,299 Covid-19 cases in lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks

Advertisement

Britain today recorded the fewest daily Covid-19 cases in almost eight weeks in yet another sign that England's lockdown is working as 11,299 more positive tests were declared — but deaths are at a six-month high.

Today's infections marked a fall of 43.6 per cent on the 20,051 last Tuesday and 27 per cent drop on yesterday's 15,450. Daily cases are now at their lowest since October 2, when fewer than 7,000 Britons were diagnosed.

The UK also announced 608 Covid deaths in the last 24 hours, which is the highest daily total since May 12, when the disease claimed 614 victims. However, there are signs fatalities have started to level off as today's death toll is only 1.7 per cent higher than last Tuesday, when there were 598 victims.

Covid deaths lag two to three weeks behind the infections trend due to the time it takes for people to fall seriously ill with the disease. Experts anticipate deaths will start to tail off next month, after the country's second lockdown has ended.

The seven-day rolling average number of coronavirus cases — considered a more accurate measurement because it takes into account day-to-day recording fluctuations — is now 18,295, the lowest since October 20. Daily deaths are averaging 442.

It comes as it was revealed three households will be allowed to form 'Christmas bubbles' over the festive period after politicians across the UK agreed to ease draconian restrictions and give hard-pressed families respite from coronavirus rules.

A four-nation meeting of the Cobra emergency committee this afternoon agreed plans to allow extended families and friends to meet without social distancing within exclusive groups. The relaxed measures will be in place from December 23 to 27, paving the way for families in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to meet up.

COVID RESTRICTIONS WILL BE EASED ACROSS THE UK FOR FIVE DAYS AT CHRISTMAS Coronavirus restrictions will be eased across the UK for five days at Christmas to allow up to three households to meet indoors after the four home nations agreed a joint plan to loosen draconian curbs over the festive period. A four-nation meeting of the Cobra emergency committee agreed the proposals this afternoon. The relaxed measures will be in place from Wednesday December 23 to Sunday December 27, paving the way for families in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to meet up. It came after Nicola Sturgeon had earlier suggested the Christmas respite from coronavirus lockdown would not be entirely the same in Scotland. The First Minister said she hoped there would be an agreement on a 'common framework' for the festive season. But she hinted at splits between the nations saying the 'precise definition of household' is likely to vary. Scotland currently has different rules on gatherings compared to England, including not including under-12s in limits on numbers. Advertisement

In England, those already in 'support bubbles' with vulnerable or lonely relatives living elsewhere will count as one household under the new rules - extending the size of potential gatherings.

Travel across tiers in England will also be allowed, as will journeys between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

But in a blow for the hospitality industry, the Christmas bubbles will only be allowed to meet up in private homes, places of worship and in outdoor public spaces.

Rules for pubs, restaurants and other venues will remain the same under whichever tier they find themselves in at the time.

The agreement was made between Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and the First Ministers of the devolved governments.

Speaking following the meeting, Mr Gove said: 'The UK-wide agreement reached today will offer hope for families and friends who have made many sacrifices over this difficult year.

'We know that the Christmas period this year will not be normal, but following constructive discussions between the UK Government and the devolved administrations, families and friends will now have the option to meet up in a limited and cautious way across the UK should they wish.

'In coming to this agreement, we have listened to scientific and clinical advice on how best to minimise the risk and reach a balanced and workable set of rules that we hope will allow people to spend time together at this important time of year.'

Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said: 'We have to recognise that Christmas is a very important time for people, and that you have to have a set of rules that people will be prepared to operate within.'

He added: 'While I have hesitation, because of the state of the virus in Wales and across the United Kingdom, it is better that we have a common set of arrangements that give people a framework that they can manage within and act responsibly within as well.'

The onerous tiered system will be in place across England from December 3 until the end of March, the Prime Minister said

NO10 CHERRY-PICKED 'SPURIOUS' COVID DATA TO JUSTIFY ENGLAND'S SECOND LOCKDOWN, TOP EXPERT CLAIMS Number 10 cherry-picked 'spurious' coronavirus data to justify England's second lockdown and may have intended to frightened the public, according to one of Britain's top experts. Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter said ministers had 'broken pretty much every code of conduct' by choosing only to show worst-case scenarios, which were often based on out of date data. The Cambridge professor told MPs today: 'I don't want to ascribe motivation to anyone of course. But if someone was really trying to manipulate the audience and frighten them and persuade them that what was being done was correct, rather than genuinely inform them, then this is the kind of thing they might do.' Doom-mongering graphs which predicted 50,000 cases by mid-October and 4,000 deaths a day by late November were used by Downing Street to justify England's second lockdown. Those fantastical charts were widely ridiculed because the country was recording 14,000 daily infections last month and daily deaths currently average 441. Speaking at a House of Commons select committee today, Professor Spiegelhalter added: 'Those projections were made by one team early in October under certain very pessimistic assumptions. 'They'd already been revised twice by the time they were shown to the public so it was completely inappropriate to present them to the public. 'I'm not saying the judgment [to decide to go into lockdown] was wrong, I'm not making any comment about that. Advertisement

It came after Nicola Sturgeon had earlier suggested the Christmas respite from coronavirus lockdown would not be entirely the same in Scotland.

Tonight she said: 'We know that for some, contact with friends and family is crucial during this time as isolation and loneliness can hit people especially hard over the Christmas period. The ''bubble'' approach aims to reduce this impact.

'But we must be clear, there cannot be any further relaxation of measures for Hogmanay. Even this short relaxation will give the virus a chance to spread. Our priority is to suppress transmission of COVID-19 and reduce the risk to the vulnerable and those who have spent so long shielding - and that involves abiding by the rules.

'Just because you can mix with others indoors over this time, that doesn't mean you have to. If you choose to stick with the rules as they are, then you will be continuing the hard work to beat this virus and prevent its spread.'

Scotland currently has different rules on gatherings compared to England, including not including under-12s in limits on numbers.

Frantic efforts have been going on for days to find a joint position for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to allow some kind of family Christmas.

An announcement had been expected today, but that was cast into doubt earlier when government sources conceded that 'details need ironing out'.

It comes as Mr Johnson faces a Tory revolt over his new local lockdown plans for December 2 onwards.

MPs have warned Boris Johnson that putting swathes of the country under draconian Tier Two and Three restrictions will be 'catastrophic' for businesses and spark a damaging new mutiny.

Ministers insist they are waiting for the latest local infection data to decide what brackets individual areas will be placed into, with the breakdown set to be published on Thursday.

However, senior Conservatives say the 'mood music' is that most places will be subject to the tougher levels - meaning heavy restrictions on bars and restaurants, as well as limits on households mixing.

There are complaints that the criteria being used to decide the Tier allocations are too vague, and the geographical areas too broad.

MPs and London Mayor Sadiq Khan have been lobbying to stay out of the harshest levels.

Alarmingly for Mr Johnson, the chair of the powerful 1922 said this afternoon that he is 'inclined' to oppose the measures in a vote next week. Sir Graham Brady said he was concerned the damage being inflicted on the economy will leave a 'legacy we could be living with for years to come'.

THERE WAS ENOUGH INFORMATION ON COVID TO ACT IN JANUARY, SAYS EXPERT Enough was known about coronavirus in January to act straight away, but the response was delayed, a leading scientist has said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of SAGE, said that while information about the virus was 'uncertain', action could have been taken. At the start of January the WHO was aware of a cluster of pneumonia cases - with no deaths - in Wuhan, China, and shared detailed information with member states. Speaking at the Imperial College London's Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics's (J-IDEA) symposium on a post-Covid world, Sir Jeremy said the response to the information was delayed. He said: 'The information you have early may be uncertain, but it's enough to act on. I would say that at the end of January we knew enough to have acted. And we waited. 'We waited out of uncertainty, we wanted to be more certain than we needed to be. 'But by the end of January, we knew that this was able to transmit asymptomatically, that it caused a nasty clinical syndrome and a significant number of people were dying, that healthcare workers were getting sick and distant family members were getting sick when people moved from Wuhan to Sichuan, that this was going out of China into other parts of south-east Asia, that we had no diagnostics, no treatment and no vaccines. 'To me, at the time - and this is not in retrospect - I think that was enough to have acted then in ways that we delayed.' Advertisement

Mr Johnson yesterday confirmed that the blanket lockdown in England will end as scheduled next Wednesday, but cautioned that coronavirus curbs need to stay in place until Easter despite more good news on vaccines.

Taking a press conference from self-isolation in Downing Street, Mr Johnson said: 'Tis the season to be jolly, but it is also the season to be jolly careful, especially with elderly relatives.'

He added: 'This is not the moment to let the virus rip for the sake of Christmas parties'.

The Government has revealed its new three-tier system for when the current lockdown ends on December 2.

Labour has said it is not certain to support the plan when it comes to a vote next week as Tiers are too 'risky', but looks more likely to abstain than outright oppose.

That means the government is almost guaranteed to win.

However, a substantial Tory rebellion would inflict a further blow to the PM's authority.

Sir Graham told the BBC's World at One he was unlikely to support the measures next week.

'My concern is that huge numbers of businesses, particularly but not exclusively in the hospitality sector, have been losing money under Tier Two already,' he said.

'There is a very tight limit to how much longer than they can go on doing without seeing even bigger levels of unemployment, and particularly youth unemployment.

'And we know that if we see that big economic hit, in terms of unemployment, in terms of opportunities for young people, the effects - not just economically, but the other health impacts, physical health and mental health - are enormous, and that is the legacy we could be living with for years to come.

Former minister Sir Desmond Swayne told MailOnline the critical moment will come when the Tiers are allocated.

'There is lots of concern. Will anyone get away with Tier One?' he said.

'I was in Tier One before. The mood music seems to suggest that everybody is going up one - it's going to be worse than before.

'We will have gone from lockdown to lockdown by another name. This is indefinite - it goes on to the Spring. It is a miserable situation, but it is devastating for businesses.

'It is catastrophic. These crazed scientists... to be fair they are only being asked how to stop the spread of a virus, but there has to be some consideration at a political level about how to stop the spread of economic disaster.'

Tory mayoral candidate for London Shaun Bailey and MPs in the capital have been urging the government to stop short of imposing Tier Three.

Mr Khan tweeted: 'London's unique ecosystem of bars, businesses, restaurants, clubs and cultural venues have been through an extremely tough year.

'If they had to close throughout the Christmas period and beyond in Tier 3 - it would be a hammer blow that many might not recover from.'";"(2020-06-10)

# How Do I Reduce My Belly Fat Quickly?

How Do I Reduce My Belly Fat?

Unfortunately, there is no way to quickly reduce belly fat. While fad diets may help you drop pounds quickly and possibly even trim inches off your waistline, most of that will likely be water weight and not belly fat and it will be temporary. Losing belly fat comes down to old fashioned diet and exercise, which are key factors in determining how much fat is in our bodies.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) suggests:

Limiting total fat intake to 20 to 30 percent of total calories

Keeping saturated fat intake to less than 7 percent

Limiting trans fats

Additional diet tips to help reduce belly fat include:

Reducing sugar intake The body needs very little sugar and any excess is stored as fat Cut down on sugars in empty carbohydrates such as cookies, cake, and white bread

Consume a plant-based diet Beans, lentils, peas and chickpeas (called pulses) are high in fiber and plant protein and help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce overall body fat People who consume whole grains lose more belly fat than those who eat processed grains

Intermittent fasting Based on the concept that humans were designed to eat for short periods of time followed by hours (and sometimes days) of fasting There are no food or caloric restrictions, but restrictions on WHEN to eat Popular methods include 16/8 (8 hours of eating followed by 16 hours of fasting), the “Eat-Stop-Eat” method (two 24-hour fasts per week on non-consecutive days); and the 5/2 method (only 500 calories for 2 non-consecutive days, and 5 days of normal eating per week) Intermittent fasting has been shown to help reduce belly fat



Exercise also plays a role in losing body fat and diet plus exercise works best to reduce belly fat. A study in the Journal of Applied Physiology found people who exercised regularly were able to prevent belly fat gain, or lose belly fat, compared to those who didn’t exercise. The study found that just 30 minutes of walking, 6 days per week was enough to prevent accumulation of belly fat. Exercising longer, rather than harder, worked best to lose more belly fat.

The best exercise regimen for fat loss includes both aerobic and strength exercises (resistance training). High-intensity interval training (HIIT), also called high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE), is a type of cardiovascular exercise that alternates between short bouts of high-intensity and low-intensity exercise. HIIT usually alternates between slower to moderate-intensity and high-intensity movements. The Obesity Reviews Journal reviewed 13 different studies on overweight adults and found that HIIT reduced weight and waist circumference.";"(2019-12-13)

# How Is Coffee Healthy?

What Is Coffee Good For?

Studies show moderate coffee consumption comes with a host of benefits and can help stave off cardiovascular and other problems as part of a healthy lifestyle. Just avoid heavy cream and lots of sugar; the extra calories and cholesterol could cause more harm than good.

Coffee is a popular beverage and many of us can’t live without our daily dose. According to the National Coffee Data Trends (NCDT), 63% of American adults drink coffee daily. Once suspected to be a cancer-causing agent, the World Health Organization (WHO) has removed coffee from its possible carcinogen list. But is coffee good for you? Recent studies say yes.

A 2015 study in the journal Circulation found that moderate coffee consumption (three to four cups daily) was associated with an 8 to 15 percent reduction in the overall risk of death.

Other reported health benefits of coffee include:

Alertness and performance Caffeinated coffee has been found to have a beneficial effect on alertness and improved performance

Physical endurance Studies have shown that caffeinated coffee improves physical endurance during exercises such as running and cycling It may also lower the perceived rate of exertion

Cardiovascular disease A 2018 review found that a moderate intake of coffee may be beneficial for cardiovascular conditions including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias

Type 2 diabetes Studies suggest that drinking 3 to 4 cups of coffee each day is associated with about a 25% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes, compared to drinking less than 2 cups per day or no coffee at all

Alzheimer’s disease Some studies have shown that regular coffee consumption over a lifetime can reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease

Parkinson’s disease A 2018 literature review indicated that moderate coffee consumption may lower the risk for common neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson’s disease

Certain cancers Some studies found that drinking coffee may lower the risk head and neck, colorectal, breast, uterine endometrium, and liver cancers

Cirrhosis Coffee may inhibit the onset of alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver cirrhosis

Depression One study found that increased caffeinated coffee consumption corresponded with a decreased risk for depression; more study is needed

# Scientific PROOF: Pro-inflammatory foods dramatically raise risk of heart attack and stroke

(NaturalHealth365) For years, natural health experts and integrative physicians have sounded the alarm on the dangers of the Standard American Diet – which is aptly abbreviated as SAD.  High in processed products, unhealthy fats and refined sugars, and lacking in desirable anti-inflammatory foods, SAD is believed to increase inflammation and trigger serious conditions, including heart disease and stroke.
While this concept – that the foods we eat can influence inflammation and cardiovascular health – might seem to be common sense, scientific studies on the topic were scarce.
Until last week, when a study published in the respected Journal of the American College of Cardiology showcased the dangers of pro-inflammatory foods and revealed the startling extent to which diet affects risk of heart attack and stroke.  To learn which foods are inflammation-promoting “villains” and which are inflammation-quenching “superheroes,” keep reading.
Good science REVEALS how diet affects your susceptibility to heart disease and stroke
The study, which involved 32 years of research and over 210,000 participants, allowed scientists to compare the diets of people who relied heavily on pro-inflammatory foods to the diets of people who opted for healthier, anti-inflammatory foods.
The team then used pooled analyses to evaluate the long-term risk of heart disease in the two groups.  The results were eye-opening!!
When compared to diets high in anti-inflammatory foods, diets high in pro-inflammatory foods increased heart disease risk by a stunning 46 percent and raised stroke risk by 28 percent.
Lead author Jun Li, M.D., Ph.D. – a research scientist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health – summed up the study results with this definitive sentence: “Dietary patterns with higher inflammatory potential were associated with an increased rate of cardiovascular disease.”
It doesn’t get any more cut-and-dried than that.
The team also found that people who reported regularly eating pro-inflammatory foods had higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers- such as chemokines, interleukins and adhesion molecules – along with higher levels of triglycerides and unwanted LDL cholesterol.
“Eat the rainbow” — in the form of colorful fruits and vegetables
So, how can you tell the “good guys” from the “bad guys?”  It’s easy – once you know what to look for.
Experts recommend opting for bright orange or yellow vegetables – such as squash, carrots, pumpkin and yams – which contain a disease-fighting plant pigment known as beta carotene.  Green leafy vegetables and cruciferous vegetables – such as kale, spinach, arugula, Brussels sprouts and broccoli – are also a wise choice.  In addition, cruciferous vegetables contain sulforaphane, which is not only anti-inflammatory but anticancer.
By the way, the “green leafies” also have their share of beta-carotene.  However, the orange/yellow hue is hidden behind darker green pigments.
Dark cherries, blackberries and blueberries are high in a group of plant pigments known as anthocyanins, while bright red tomatoes are loaded up with an antioxidant called lycopene.
Of course, let’s not forget healthy fats – such as nuts – are also great inflammation fighters.  In fact, recent research shows that people who enrich their normal diets with daily walnut consumption had significantly reduced inflammation and LDL cholesterol, when compared to those who didn’t.
And, finally, don’t overlook olive oil and avocados as ideal sources of beneficial fats.
The new “unconventional” wisdom: Coffee used to fight inflammatory disease?
Although coffee contains caffeine, a stimulant that can raise blood pressure, many experts feel that coffee’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits far outweigh the downside.  According to research nutritionists at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, coffee consumption may reduce internal inflammation and protect against disease.
Peer-reviewed studies have shown that coffee reduces the odds of developing Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and dementia – particularly in women.  In addition, coffee consumption dramatically slashes the risk of colon cancer and is linked with a lower risk of death from heart disease, kidney disease and diabetes.
For maximum benefit, many experts recommend three to five cups a day (for people unbothered by caffeine). If your doctor has advised you to avoid or limit caffeine, the good news is that decaffeinated coffee can still provide health benefits.
Naturally, if you’re going to drink coffee … be sure it’s organic and skip the white sugar.  You can flavor it up with cinnamon, vanilla extract or cocoa powder instead.  If you really want to get “fancy,” try some fresh made hemp or almond milk.
Avoid or sharply limit these inflammatory foods
Major pro-inflammatory culprits include processed meats like, bacon, ham, hot dogs, bologna and packaged lunch meats.  Generally speaking, most health experts will tell you to avoid: refined sugar, sugar-laden drinks and refined grain products such as white bread, white rice, crackers and baked goods.
In addition, stay away from … fried foods, trans fats, chemical preservatives, artificial sweeteners, fast foods and GMOs.  All of these items will greatly increase the risk of chronic inflammation.
Red ALERT: Pro-inflammatory foods reduce levels of a natural fat-burning substance
The new study – we’re featuring above – found that people who ate a pro-inflammatory diet had lower levels of adiponectin, a fat-burning hormone that can help prevent insulin resistance, combat atherosclerosis and promote weight loss.
So important is adiponectin, in fact, that low levels are linked with the development of metabolic syndrome and obesity-related illnesses.  Clearly, you don’t want to run low on this important hormone.
You can increase your adiponectin levels with daily intake of omega-3 fats, found in cold-water fatty fish, avocados, nuts and olive oil.  These just happen to be “major players” in the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in healthy fats, fruits, nuts and vegetables.
Most experts agree that the Mediterranean diet is vastly superior to the SAD when it comes to supporting heart health.  So, clearly, it just might be time to give this anti-inflammatory – and flavorful – way of eating a try.

# Coronavirus Today: ‘Band-Aids on a very big wound’

Good evening. I’m Amina Khan, and it’s Tuesday, Nov. 24. Here’s what’s happening with the coronavirus in California and beyond.

As the world’s worst pandemic in more than a century rages, how should we try to manage a safer Thanksgiving?

It’s a question at the top of many Americans’ minds this week, and my colleague Rong-Gong Lin II is, dependably, here with the answers for you.

The lowest-risk option is to cancel those travel plans, stay home for Thanksgiving and not travel, according to a panoply of federal, state and local officials. And “travel” includes everything from flying across the country to walking down the street to a neighbor’s home. The point is to keep households from mixing and inadvertently transmitting the coronavirus to one another.

“The safest way to celebrate Thanksgiving is to celebrate at home with the people you live with,” said Barbara Ferrer, director of public health for Los Angeles County.

College students returning home just for the Thanksgiving holiday are a particularly risky bunch, especially if their homes include family members who are elderly or have common medical issues like high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, or kidney and lung disease. Keep in mind, people who are infected but don’t feel sick can be highly contagious and easily infect others, who could then develop severe complications and even die from COVID-19.

If you plan an extended stay, you should quarantine yourself in a room alone for 14 days, avoid sharing a bathroom (or clean it every time you do share one), eat alone and have everyone at home wear masks all the time when indoors.

“The tighter you can restrict your activities over those 14 days, the better off we all are,” Ferrer said.

Remember, a negative coronavirus test can be misleading. All it means is that the test didn’t detect the virus in your body. It could still be there, but at levels too low to pick up. This can happen early in infection, before the virus has a chance to make enough copies of itself to trigger a positive test result.

That’s why “you can’t ‘test out’ of quarantine, as much as people would like to,” Ferrer said. “Because it’s a 14-day incubation period, that really means that from the time of your last exposure to the virus ... it could take the full 14 days for you to be able to actually test positive for the virus.”

If you do decide to hold a Thanksgiving meal anyway with folks from other households, there are ways to mitigate the worst coronavirus risks. For example, California has announced certain requirements and recommendations for gatherings in counties in the most restrictive “purple” tier of the state’s pandemic reopening plan. Among them:

Advertisement

• Gatherings must be held outside and involve people from no more than three households. (In Los Angeles County, they are also limited to no more than 15 people.)

• The gathering space must be large enough for everyone to maintain at least a six-foot distance from others who don’t live in their household.

• Food and beverages must be served by someone who wears a face covering and washes their hands often.

• Face coverings must be worn, and removed only when people are actively eating or drinking.

• Gatherings should be kept to two hours or less. The longer an event, the higher the risk of transmission, authorities say.

Across California

California has completely smashed its past daily record for coronavirus cases, coming in with 20,654 new infections on Monday — far above the previous all-pandemic record of 13,400 infections. Los Angeles County also posted a daily record of more than 6,000 new cases.

Over the last five days, the state has logged a total of 65,168 new coronavirus cases, according to data compiled by The Times. That’s nearly three times as high as the 24,263 new cases recorded in the state during the five-day period that ended Oct. 23, just a month ago.

This major surge has moved the state into troubling new ground right on the cusp of the Thanksgiving holiday, which could touch off another round of super-spreading events.

The number of COVID-19 hospitalizations climbed roughly 82% from two weeks earlier, to 5,459. Coronavirus-related intensive care admissions also rose 59% over the same period, to 1,333, state data show.

It’s not just records being shattered, said L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. Lives are being shattered alongside them.

“There’s too much transmission happening here right now in this county — too much transmission with too many meetings of too many people,” Garcetti said. “So the solution is simple; we know it, and we can do it: Stay away from each other. Assume everybody you would see is infectious and, please, let us not make this Thanksgiving the deadliest day of this pandemic.”

The pandemic continues to threaten many of California’s 5 million small businesses. For a time, loans and grants from Congress’ $2.2-trillion CARES Act helped some of them weather the collapse in their customer bases and supply chains. Now those funds have dried up — and many are wondering if they can survive a longer downturn without some federal assistance.

Take Cynde and John Harris, who operate Go Kart World in Carson along an industrial strip by the 405 Freeway. After customers fled and health officials shut down the business, the couple furloughed 35 workers. Over the next few months, they managed to get two federal loans for a total of $270,000. A $30,000 grant from Los Angeles County came through in October, and Go Kart World reopened this month.

Harris is still worried, though. “You can only take on so much debt,” she said. “It’s bitter medicine to be told, ‘You can borrow the money,’ when a government closure just drove a truck through your business.”

Without new federal aid, tens of thousands of California small businesses may find themselves back on the brink.

“The loans they got gave many businesses some moments of respite,” said John Kabateck, California director of the National Federation of Independent Business. “But they were Band-Aids on a very big wound. Now they’re very, very terrified.”

Los Angeles County’s ban on outdoor dining is being met with some resistance from the California Restaurant Assn., which filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court to block it from going into effect. But a judge declined to do so Tuesday, which means that restaurants must shut down their open-air operations Wednesday night.

Jot Condie, the restaurant group’s CEO, expressed disappointment that the judge didn’t “pump the brakes” on the closure but said he was glad the suit could move forward.

“We are pleased that the court recognized our right to put the county to the test to prove that they have a scientific basis for the shutdown of outdoor dining, and we plan to move forward in requiring the county to offer that proof,” Condie said.

The outdoor closure order, which applies to restaurants, breweries, wineries and bars for at least three weeks, was announced Sunday as part of a larger effort to get surging coronavirus cases under control.

The restaurant association isn’t the only source of pushback. The city of Pasadena said Monday that it will let restaurants continue outdoor dining despite the county order. The city has its own public health department that can issue independent orders, but has generally followed L.A. County’s lead. (Long Beach’s public health department sided with L.A. County and issued a similar health order.)

Around the nation and the world

If you’re like me, you’re waiting with bated breath for the arrival of the first COVID-19 vaccines, the first of which could be arriving in a matter of weeks. But let that breath out — safely, behind a mask — because it’s still going to be a long while before you can hit up a concert, laugh with friends in a crowded restaurant or hug your grandparents.

The first vaccine shipments in the United States will be just the beginning of what could be a long and turbulent ride to herd immunity and the return of something resembling normal life.

“If you’re fighting a battle and the cavalry is on the way, you don’t stop shooting; you keep going until the cavalry gets here, and then you might even want to continue fighting,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert.

First off, most folks won’t get those early vaccine supplies. They’ll likely be reserved for first responders and the most vulnerable among us, such as the elderly. Second, the front-running vaccines must be taken in two doses administered a month apart — which means we’ll probably be well into late January before even the earliest birds are fully protected.

Getting to herd immunity will take even longer. Early data on the efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna shots suggest that about 70% of the population will need to be vaccinated to reach that milestone, and that will likely happen in May, according to Moncef Slaoui, head of the U.S. vaccine development effort.

The federal prison system will be among the first government agencies to get the COVID-19 vaccine — with a caveat. Those first precious doses will be given to staff and not to inmates, even though infected prisoners far outnumber infected staff. Since the pandemic first arrived on U.S. shores, 18,467 inmates and 1,736 staff have recovered from COVID-19, and 141 inmates and two staff members have died.

Prisons are a dangerously easy environment for the coronavirus to spread; with inmates sleeping close together and sharing bathrooms, social distancing is essentially nonexistent behind bars. In the pandemic’s early days, prisoners and staffers said the Bureau of Prisons had run short of even basic supplies such as soap.

Now the situation appears to be getting worse. Nearly 25% of all inmate cases and 30% of staff cases have been reported just in the last month.

“If true, it’s a disgrace,” David Patton, the head of the federal defender office in New York, said of the plan to vaccinate staffers but not inmates. “Prisoners are among the very highest-risk groups for contracting COVID-19. ... The government should certainly prioritize prison staff, but to not also prioritize the people incarcerated is irresponsible and inhumane.”

Across the pond in Britain, authorities Tuesday gave residents a green light to gather for the holidays, relaxing restrictions on social mixing over Christmas. They also offered inbound international travelers a way to cut quarantine short if they test negative for COVID-19.

Between Dec. 23 and 27, members of up to three households can form a “Christmas bubble” and move freely between them. Under current restrictions, people are barred from visiting members of other households in much of the U.K.

Cabinet minister Michael Gove said the agreement “will offer hope for families and friends who have made many sacrifices over this difficult year.”

But while government scientific advisers have signed off on the restriction-relaxing plan, others have warned that the policy will probably lead to a rise in coronavirus infections around the country.

The U.K. logged 11,299 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, marking the lowest level since early October.



Your questions answered

Today’s question comes from a reader who wants to know: If your toes turn red but you have no other symptoms, could you have the coronavirus?

Advertisement

This reader appears to be referring to what’s come to be known as “COVID toes,” a condition that causes a person infected with the coronavirus to develop discolored and swollen toes. According to the American Academy of Dermatology Assn., COVID toes most commonly seem to develop in children, teens and young adults, though they can appear at any age.

Many of these patients never develop more common symptoms of COVID-19, such as a dry cough, fever and muscle aches. And when they do have symptoms of COVID-19, the symptoms tend to be mild.

“In general, individuals who get COVID toes are otherwise healthy,” said Dr. Amy Paller, director of the Skin Disease Research Center at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “A subset have — or more often have had in the previous month — some other types of symptoms that can be seen in viral disorders.”

So yes, it‘s possible that COVID toes are your only sign of a coronavirus infection. But plenty of people with red, swollen toes also test negative for infection, Paller said. More work needs to be done to suss out the link between the virus and this phenomenon.

# Now it’s just getting stupid: AMA declares racism a “public health threat” in virtue-signal to leftists

(Natural News)
 For nearly a year, Democrats and left-wing academics who claim to know all about COVID-19 “science” have been telling us fairy tales like all masks work, perpetual lockdowns are good and don’t cause additional harm, and President Donald Trump didn’t lift a finger in response to the pandemic.
First of all, the only proven effective mask against COVID is the N-95. Second, perpetual lockdowns have led to spikes in mental health problems, domestic violence and an increase in cardiac-related home deaths. And third, Trump mobilized the federal government and private industry to do everything from manufacturing new ventilators to developing new treatments for the virus in record time.
So when the academic left tried to claim they have cornered the market on ‘the science’ of things, we tend to disbelieve that right away.
And the academic left continues to give us reasons to not only doubt them but to openly mock them as well. Like the American Medical Association.
The AMA now wants us to believe that racism is the new COVID or something, a “public health threat” so dire that it warrants attention and, of course, resources.
RT reports: 
The American Medical Association (AMA) has voted to recognize racism as a “public health threat” and pledged to “actively work on dismantling racist policies.” Some cheered the decision, while others were dismayed by the move.
The new policy rules, adopted on Monday, are aimed at combating racist policies and practices across all US healthcare, according to a press release on the AMA website.
“The AMA recognizes that racism negatively impacts and exacerbates health inequities among historically marginalized communities. Without systemic and structural-level change, health inequities will continue to exist, and the overall health of the nation will suffer,” said AMA Board Member Willarda V. Edwards, M.D., M.B.A. “As physicians and leaders in medicine, we are committed to optimal health for all, and are working to ensure all people and communities reach their full health potential. Declaring racism as an urgent public health threat is a step in the right direction toward advancing equity in medicine and public health, while creating pathways for truth, healing, and reconciliation.”
What “truth?” What, exactly, needs to be ‘healed?’ And “reconciliation” — for what, exactly? Where’s this lunatic’s evidence? Isn’t he required to present some?
And does he realize that he has just called every single white person a racist who is somehow contributing to the ‘public health threat’?
RT noted further: 
In the realm of US healthcare, the claim is often made that minorities face discrimination by doctors and other medical staff, and are not taken as seriously as white patients when describing their symptoms, leading to avoidable complications.
Yes, of course this claim is often made, but by leftists with an agenda. We’re also told by some of these same lunatics that there is ‘systemic racism’ in our country and that all police are “racists” against black people — including, presumably, black, Hispanic and Asian police officers.
And yet, as is the case with this ridiculous declaration by the AMA, these claims are always made matter-of-factly, as if we’re all supposed to just ‘know’ that they are true. No proof required.
Indeed, when hard data is presented to refute these baseless claims, that data is dismissed as “bias” when in reality, the accusation itself is where the bias lies.
There is no widespread evidence that racism is a “public health threat.” Blacks — and Americans of all ethnicities — do not have any substantial problem getting health care, period. (Related: Gun control is racism.)
There are, of course, exceptions. But don’t say that it’s just one-sided; for every left-wing activist at the AMA claiming that minorities can’t get decent healthcare, there are thousands of poor white voices in places like Appalachia who will say the same thing.
Is that ‘racism’ too? Or is racism only a “public health threat” as it applies to people of color?
If you’re like us, you’re sick and tired of virtue-signaling morons who are inventing problems to self-inflate their own importance. They don’t care how badly they gaslight the country and thereby worsen our divisions and tribalism in the process.

# Coronavirus testing can be manipulated to make vaccines look more effective

(Natural News)
 In the race to develop vaccines against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), a number of pharmaceutical companies are now claiming that they have developed highly effective vaccines. At least one skeptic, however, is raising alarms about this, warning that these companies will fake the success of their vaccines by rigging coronavirus testing.
In an op-ed in the Waking Times, freelance investigative reporter Jon Rappoport says that the whole plan to fast-track Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the vaccines “is a stark fraud.”
Rappoport bases his argument on the fact that the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test used to detect the coronavirus is highly prone to false-positive results. This is supposedly due to the high number of “cycles” – up to 40 –  required by the FDA.
“When you blow up that tissue sample above 34 cycles, you get gigantic numbers of false-positive results, even by the standards of the test,” he wrote. “Fauci has admitted it. I’ve pointed out that FDA guidelines nevertheless recommend doing the test at up to 40 cycles. This alone explains reports of ‘rising COVID case numbers,’” he adds.
Big Pharma claims vaccines are highly effective
Rappoport’s piece comes after Moderna, one of the companies vying to develop a marketable COVID-19 shot, announced that its vaccine is 94.5 percent effective against the coronavirus. This makes it the second vaccine in the U.S. to have a stunningly high success rate. Last week, Pfizer claimed that their vaccine is more than 90 percent effective, according to early data.
“These are obviously very exciting results,” said National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci. “It’s just as good as it gets – 94.5 percent is truly outstanding.”
Fauci stated that vaccinations for high-risk groups could begin in the second half of December, with the shot being made available for the rest of the population next spring.
Moderna got its results on a call on Nov. 15 with members of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board, the independent panel analyzing the company’s trial data.
“It was one of the greatest moments in my life and my career. It is absolutely amazing to be able to develop this vaccine and see the ability to prevent symptomatic disease with such high efficacy,” said Moderna’s chief medical officer Dr. Tal Zaks.
During the company’s vaccine trial, 15,000 study participants were given the vaccine and only five of them developed COVID-19. Notably, all five cases were reported to be mild. According to Moderna, their vaccine did not have any serious side effects apart from a few who reported body aches and headaches.
Moderna says that it plans to apply to the FDA for authorization of its vaccine soon after accumulating more safety data later this month.
Testing protocols can be manipulated to make vaccines seem more effective than they actually are
Rappoport, however, says that the vaccine trials are all part of a con, and that the second con will take place after Moderna and Pfizer gain FDA approval to launch their vaccines. With PCR testing highly prone to manipulation, Rappoport claims it will be easy to make any vaccine seem like a roaring success.
Currently, PCR tests are set to 40 cycles, as per FDA recommendation. With each cycle, genetic elements present in human samples are amplified until they reach easily detectable and quantifiable amounts. But when samples are run above 34 cycles, Rappoport says they’re prone to generate false-positive results.
This is how he believes those who are involved in the fraud will perpetuate the lie that the approved COVID-19 vaccines are successful.
“After a suitable period of time, the elite medical planners will change the way the PCR test is done,” says, Rappoport. “The number of cycles will be drastically reduced. That order will go out to labs in the U.S.”
Doing this will result in a significant drop in the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and the decline will then be attributed to the salutatory effect of the vaccine.
While Rappoport’s claims may sound outlandish, reports have come in of independent laboratories noticing high numbers of false-positive coronavirus tests. Considering this, the idea that PCR tests could be manipulated to make the vaccines look more effective seems plausible.

# Lower your cholesterol naturally with these nutrients

(Natural News)
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in three Americans suffers from high blood cholesterol, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke.
Eating plenty of fatty foods and red meat is the usual cause of high cholesterol. However, this health condition does not present symptoms. For this reason, stroke or heart attack often seems sudden when either occurs.
Fortunately, you can easily reverse high cholesterol and minimize your CVD risk by increasing your consumption of certain dietary nutrients. Here are six nutrients that are known to help lower cholesterol levels: (Related: How naturopathy helps with controlling cholesterol.)
Niacin
Niacin, or vitamin B3, helps raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. HDL, commonly referred to as the “good” cholesterol, helps remove low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from the bloodstream. LDL, or “bad” cholesterol, can form plaques along the walls of the arteries and clog them, raising the risk CVD and stroke.
Niacin is abundant in the following foods:

Chicken liver
Chicken breast
Grass-fed beef
Peanuts
Avocado
Brown rice
Whole wheat
Mushrooms
Green peas
Potatoes
Fatty fish (tuna, salmon and anchovies)

Monacolin K
Red yeast rice contains monacolin K, a plant compound said to be identical to the active component of the cholesterol-lowering drug, lovastatin. Red yeast rice can be taken as a supplement to help reduce blood cholesterol levels and improve heart health.
Phytosterols
Phytosterols, or plant sterols, are compounds found in the cell membranes of plants. They have a similar structure to human cholesterol and can help reduce LDL and overall cholesterol levels when ingested. These plant-based foods provide high amounts of phytosterols:

Nuts
Flaxseeds
Broccoli
Red onion
Carrot
Brussels sprouts
Spinach
Berries
Banana
Lettuce

Soluble fiber
During digestion, soluble fiber from the foods you eat dissolves in water and is broken down into a gel-like substance in the colon. This gel-like substance slows digestion and traps LDL cholesterol, preventing it from entering the bloodstream and traveling to various parts of the body.
According to recent studies, consuming five to 10 grams of soluble fiber every day can reduce cholesterol by five percent.
The following foods contain significant amounts of soluble fiber:

Brussels sprouts
Sweet potatoes
Avocados
Turnips
Pears
Figs
Oats
Beans
Apples
Barley
Guavas
Carrots
Flaxseeds
Hazelnuts
Sunflower seeds

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)
CoQ10 is a nutrient naturally produced by the body and used for the production of cellular energy. It is hailed for its antioxidant properties and its ability to significantly reduce cholesterol levels.
Some studies suggest that taking CoQ10 supplements can help reduce the adverse side effects of statins, a class of lipid-lowering drugs. Such side effects include weakness, muscle aches and joint pains.
CoQ10 can be found in several foods, such as:

Organ meats (heart, liver and kidney)
Grass-fed beef
Chicken
Cauliflower
Strawberries
Sesame seeds
Pistachios
Lentils
Oranges
Fatty fish (trout, herring and mackerel)

Ginger compounds
A study published in The Journal of Nutrition revealed that ginger extract significantly reduces LDL cholesterol and helps prevent the development of atherosclerotic lesions.
In a more recent study, researchers from the Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran also found that ginger helps reduce total cholesterol levels and improves the lipid profile of diabetic patients.
Eating more of the right nutrients as part of a balanced diet helps naturally reduce cholesterol levels and keep both CVD and stroke at bay.

# Do you have high cholesterol or triglycerides? Check your vitamin D levels

(Natural News)
 Cholesterol levels are an important marker of cardiovascular health. While your body needs cholesterol to build healthy cells, high levels of it can increase your risk of heart disease. Cholesterol is a fatty substance. If it accumulates in your blood vessels, it can restrict blood flow and form blood clots, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.
Your total cholesterol levels consist of the amount of triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in your blood. Triglycerides and LDL cholesterol can accumulate in your body and clog your blood vessels. Meanwhile, HDL cholesterol helps protect you from heart disease.
One factor that may affect cholesterol levels is vitamin D deficiency. In a study published in the journal Nutrition Reviews, study author Daniel Dibaba of the University of Kentucky and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center found that people with vitamin D deficiency improved their cholesterol levels upon taking vitamin D supplements.
Vitamin D improves cholesterol levels

Previous studies have linked vitamin?D deficiency to heart attacks, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, stroke and other conditions associated with cardiovascular disease, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Other studies have also suggested that vitamin?D may have a beneficial effect on one’s cholesterol profile and cardiovascular health.
To evaluate these findings, Dibaba analyzed 41 randomized controlled trials that examined the effect of vitamin?D supplementation on cholesterol levels. The studies involved more than 3,400 participants, half of whom took vitamin D supplements while the remaining half took a placebo. A quarter of the trials had follow-up periods of over six months.
Dibaba found that the volunteers who took vitamin D supplements significantly reduced their total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and maintained healthy HDL cholesterol levels. These improvements, according to the Dibaba, were more pronounced in the participants with vitamin D deficiency. (Related: Magnesium and vitamin D: The perfect pair?)
 “Vitamin?D supplementation may be useful in hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) patients with vitamin?D insufficiency who are at high risk of cardiovascular diseases,” wrote Dibaba.

Prevent vitamin D deficiency
Vitamin D deficiency is an important health issue in the U.S. Around 56 percent of Caucasian infants and 35 percent of American adults have vitamin D deficiency.
Your body produces vitamin D when you’re exposed to sunlight. But the increased use of sunscreen and spending less time outdoors can affect how much vitamin D is produced by your body.
Other factors that lead to lower vitamin D levels include: (h/t to HopkinsMedicine.org)

Obesity and being overweight – Fat cells absorb vitamin D and keep it from circulating throughout the bloodstream.
Dark skin – People with dark skin have a built-in natural sunscreen in melanin, which prevents the skin from synthesizing vitamin D.
Sex – Women tend to have lower vitamin D levels than men. That’s because women have more body fat and often spend more time indoors. Women also tend to wear hats and sunscreen more often than men.
Age – As you get older, your body absorbs less vitamin D from your diet and produces less vitamin D in the skin.
Location – Areas farther away from the equator don’t receive enough sunlight from November to February.

Take vitamin D supplements and eat more foods rich in vitamin D to prevent vitamin D deficiency. These foods include fatty fish, fortified orange juice, egg yolk, liver, cereal and milk. If you’re taking supplements, the recommended daily amount of vitamin D is 400 international units (IU) for children up to 12 months of age, 600 IU for ages 1 to 70 years and 800 IU for adults over 70 years.

Other studies have also suggested that vitamin?D may have a beneficial effect on one’s cholesterol profile and cardiovascular health.
To evaluate these findings, Dibaba analyzed 41 randomized controlled trials that examined the effect of vitamin?D supplementation on cholesterol levels. The studies involved more than 3,400 participants, half of whom took vitamin D supplements while the remaining half took a placebo. A quarter of the trials had follow-up periods of over six months.
Dibaba found that the volunteers who took vitamin D supplements significantly reduced their total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and maintained healthy HDL cholesterol levels. These improvements, according to the Dibaba, were more pronounced in the participants with vitamin D deficiency. (Related: Magnesium and vitamin D: The perfect pair?)
 “Vitamin?D supplementation may be useful in hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) patients with vitamin?D insufficiency who are at high risk of cardiovascular diseases,” wrote Dibaba.

Prevent vitamin D deficiency
Vitamin D deficiency is an important health issue in the U.S. Around 56 percent of Caucasian infants and 35 percent of American adults have vitamin D deficiency.
Your body produces vitamin D when you’re exposed to sunlight. But the increased use of sunscreen and spending less time outdoors can affect how much vitamin D is produced by your body.
Other factors that lead to lower vitamin D levels include: (h/t to HopkinsMedicine.org)

Obesity and being overweight – Fat cells absorb vitamin D and keep it from circulating throughout the bloodstream.
Dark skin – People with dark skin have a built-in natural sunscreen in melanin, which prevents the skin from synthesizing vitamin D.
Sex – Women tend to have lower vitamin D levels than men. That’s because women have more body fat and often spend more time indoors. Women also tend to wear hats and sunscreen more often than men.
Age – As you get older, your body absorbs less vitamin D from your diet and produces less vitamin D in the skin.
Location – Areas farther away from the equator don’t receive enough sunlight from November to February.

Take vitamin D supplements and eat more foods rich in vitamin D to prevent vitamin D deficiency. These foods include fatty fish, fortified orange juice, egg yolk, liver, cereal and milk. If you’re taking supplements, the recommended daily amount of vitamin D is 400 international units (IU) for children up to 12 months of age, 600 IU for ages 1 to 70 years and 800 IU for adults over 70 years.

# Anxiety Associated With Faster Alzheimer’s Disease Onset

Summary: Anxiety may accelerate the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. Brain scans revealed patients who progressed from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease had decreased volume in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

Anxiety is associated with an increased rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study being presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Alzheimer’s disease represents a major public health crisis worldwide. The number of deaths from the disease has more than doubled since 2000, and it is currently the fifth-leading cause of death among individuals over 65 in the U.S.

Many people with Alzheimer’s disease first suffer from mild cognitive impairment, a decline in cognitive abilities like memory and thinking skills that is more rapid than normally associated with aging. Anxiety has been frequently observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment, although its role in disease progression is not well understood.

“We know that volume loss in certain areas of the brain is a factor that predicts progression to Alzheimer’s disease,” said study senior author Maria Vittoria Spampinato, M.D., professor of radiology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston. “In this study, we wanted to see if anxiety had an effect on brain structure, or if the effect of anxiety was independent from brain structure in favoring the progression of disease.”

The study group included 339 patients, average age of 72 years, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 cohort. Each person had a baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment; 72 progressed to Alzheimer’s disease while 267 remained stable.

The researchers obtained brain MRIs to determine the baseline volumes of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, two areas important to forming memories. They also tested for the presence of the ApoE4 allele, the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Anxiety was measured with established clinical surveys.

As expected, patients who progressed to Alzheimer’s disease had significantly lower volumes in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex and greater frequency of the ApoE4 allele. Most notably though, the researchers found that anxiety was independently associated with cognitive decline.

“Mild cognitive impairment patients with anxiety symptoms developed Alzheimer’s disease faster than individuals without anxiety, independently of whether they had a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease or brain volume loss,” said study first author Jenny L. Ulber, a medical student at MUSC.

The link between anxiety symptoms and a faster progression to Alzheimer’s disease presents an opportunity for improving the screening and management of patients with early mild cognitive impairment, the researchers said.

“We need to better understand the association between anxiety disorders and cognitive decline,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We don’t know yet if the anxiety is a symptom–in other words, their memory is getting worse and they become anxious–or if anxiety contributes to cognitive decline. If we were able in the future to find that anxiety is actually causing progression, then we should more aggressively screen for anxiety disorders in the elderly.”

“The geriatric population is routinely screened for depression in many hospitals, but perhaps this vulnerable population should also be assessed for anxiety disorders,” Ulber added. “Middle-aged and elderly individuals with high level of anxiety may benefit from intervention, whether it be pharmacological or cognitive behavioral therapy, with the goal of slowing cognitive decline.”

The study was based on MRI scans done at one point in time. For future research, the team would like to study MRIs obtained after the initial scan to better understand the connection between anxiety and brain structure.

“We’re now interested in looking at changes over time to see if anxiety has an effect one way or the other on how fast the brain damage progresses,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We will also take a closer look at gender differences in the association between anxiety and cognitive decline.”

# How to Find and Follow a Sleep Routine That’s Right for You

Your body and brain thrive on routine — and part of what sets that routine is a consistent sleep schedule. “Your brain releases hormones that make you sleepy and awake at certain times,” says Samantha Anders, PhD, a Minneapolis-based psychologist in private practice who treats insomnia and sleep disorders.

The more you stick to that schedule, the stronger those sleep and wake signals get (meaning you spend less time tossing and turning before sleep when you turn in and feel more alert when it’s time to wake).

So what’s the ideal schedule for you? The recommendation from the National Sleep Foundation is for adults to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep at night — note that sleep needs change slightly for people of different ages. But health organizations recommend sleep ranges (rather than a specific amount) because we’re all slightly different, too.

“Everyone has a different natural rhythm when it comes to their sleep, which is partly hereditary,” says Dr. Anders. Of course, behavioral habits and lifestyle factors come into play. For example, you may need to wake up at a certain time for work or to get kids off to school, which helps train your body to follow a certain schedule. You may be on electronic devices late at night, and the blue light they emit can shift your clock to a later bedtime.

How to Tell if You’re Getting Enough Sleep

If you’re getting the amount of sleep you personally need, you’ll feel awake and alert all day long. While it’s natural to experience a slight dip in energy in the afternoon, you should not be struggling to stay awake at 3 p.m., says Anders. “You should feel with-it and be able to think clearly.”

MORE ON SELF-CARE The Ultimate Self-Care Workbook Learn More Another hint that you’re on track with a sleep schedule that’s working for you is if you feel really sleepy before bedtime. Another hint that you’re on track with a sleep schedule that’s working for you is if you feel really sleepy before bedtime.

But, it’s worth pointing out that there are a lot of factors that affect your biological clock and make you feel more or less awake, whether you’re getting enough sleep or not, says Anders. “Light and stimulation are two big ones,” she explains.

What foods you’re eating or drinking, when you’re physically active (or not), stress, and when you’re exposing your eyes to a lot of blue light (either from the sun or screens), can affect how sleepy or awake you feel, too. For example, even if your body is ready for sleep in the evening, artificial light as well as staring at a phone or TV sends signals to the brain to stay awake, says Anders. If you’re feeling anxious about meeting a big deadline at work, stress signals may be overriding signs from your body that you’re actually overtired.

If you’re still unsure whether or not your sleep routine is working for you, think back to the last time you took a weeklong vacation and didn’t have to set an alarm. How much sleep did you need then? Where did your natural sleep patterns fall when you had extended time off and didn’t have to sleep at specific times for work or school? Paying attention to where your body naturally falls when it’s not affected by these external factors will help you uncover the pattern that works best for your body, as well as how much sleep your body really needs.

And if you stick to that pattern (more on how to do that below), the better you’ll feel and function.

The more consistent you are with your sleep the better you’ll feel — and the easier sleep will come, says Alex Dimitriu, MD, a dual-board certified doctor in psychiatry and sleep medicine in private practice in Menlo Park, California. “Everyone thinks that sleep is a one-night commitment, but the annoying thing about sleep is that one night alone will rarely make up for past sleep deprivation,” he says.

Consistent sleep benefits your long-term health, too. Case in point: A study published in August 2019 in Diabetes Care found that irregular bed and wake times were linked to metabolic problems like high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar; for every one hour of variability in sleep schedule, the risk of having metabolic syndrome rose by 27 percent.

My Sleep Schedule Isn’t Working for Me — but I Don’t Have Time to Change It!

If you struggle to prioritize sleep over other responsibilities (or late-night Netflix), and are looking for some additional motivation, focus on what sleep does for you, says Anders. When you get enough do you feel happier? Do you eat better and do better at your job? “It has to be your own individual motivation. Determine how sleep affects what you care about in your life, and it will be easier to make it a priority,” she says.

RELATED: How to Start a Self-Care Routine You’ll Follow

Of course, sometimes it’s not a matter of not being motivated to sleep — it’s a matter of other obligations getting in the way, like crying babies, second jobs, night school, and so much more. It’s helpful to know that the more consistent you can keep your sleep schedule when you can and the fewer nights you cut your sleep short, the better your body will feel in the short and long run.

For Jennifer Ashton, MD, the chief medical correspondent of ABC News, a consistent sleep-wake schedule wasn’t a problem; it was the duration of slumber that had fallen short for her in the previous few years.

Dr. Ashton suspected she’d thrive on getting more than the seven-ish hours she was currently logging with her early wake-up times for Good Morning America. “I was curious to know whether trying to get that extra thirty minutes to an hour back would make any difference in my energy, appetite, workouts, or mental acuity,” she wrote in her book The Self-Care Solution: A Year of Becoming Happier, Healthier, and Fitter — One Month at a Time.

RELATED: What Is Self-Care and Why Is It So Important for Your Health?

One thing that helped Ashton determine how much sleep she should get was Sleep Cycle, an app that uses sound and movement to track how much you sleep at night. With the data it provided, she was able to connect the dots on how much sleep she got at night and how she felt the next day. Ashton noticed that when she got at least eight hours of sleep, she was “noticeably more energetic” than with her normal seven hours.

After a month of trying to make those daily eight hours of sleep a priority, Ashton reaped big rewards, she says: “I was more productive, efficient, effective, and — a new adjective for the month — noticeably happier. With more sleep, I felt better about myself and life at large,” she wrote.

7 Tips for Optimizing Your Sleep Schedule

You know you should stay off your phone before bed and not eat too close to bedtime. But what can you do to specifically figure out the length and timing of sleep that works best for your body? What cues should you pay attention to from your body? Here’s what Anders and Dr. Dimitriu say.

1. Give Yourself 8 Hours

No matter when you set your wake and bedtime, allow an eight-hour window for sleep, says Dimitriu. You may end up getting less (and you will likely spend some time falling asleep) but make sure the opportunity to sleep is there.

2. Set Your Bedtime by Your Wake Time

Look at what time you need to get up. This time should give you enough time in the morning so you can get ready for your day without feeling rushed and should allow you to get to work or school on time. From there, count backward eight hours, and boom, that’s your ideal bedtime, says Dimitriu.

3. Find What’s Right for Your Body and Your Schedule

Notice how there’s no guideline that you must go to bed at 10 p.m.? “Everyone has a different natural rhythm, and it’s partly hereditary,” says Anders. Some people are night owls and prefer a later bedtime, and there are those who are larks who feel more energized waking up before or with the sunrise, and therefore tend to hit the hay earlier.

That said, your professional, educational, or family responsibilities may not fit in line with your biological clock. If you tend to go to bed late (say, 1 or 2 a.m.) and that’s preventing you from getting the sleep you need because you have to be awake at 7 a.m. to start your job, you need to shift your circadian rhythm back so that you can go to bed earlier, says Anders.

Limit the amount of blue light (emitted from electronic devices) you get within two to three hours of bedtime. If that’s not possible, at least wear blue-blocking glasses, she says. Electronic devices tend to keep you awake for other reasons (work or the content you’re consuming may be alerting), so it’s still preferable to work on a screen-reducing strategy.

4. Beat the Clock

Even when Ashton was busy with social or work events, she’d make sure that those things fit around her sleep schedule — not the other way around. This helped her stick to her commitment to get more sleep while not feeling like she was missing out on anything.

“I knew that if I wanted to keep sleeping for eight hours, I had to focus on continuing to go to bed earlier rather than trying to sleep later the next day. With GMA, I can’t really mess around with my wake-up time: It’s usually 5 a.m. or 5:20 a.m. at the latest, although it can be as early as 4:20 a.m.,” says Ashton. As a result, she knew that for eight hours of sleep, she had to be in bed between 9 and 9:30 p.m.

As a result, when out with friends, Ashton says she’d leave at a reasonable time and then get ready for bed as soon as she got home. If she was finishing work or other projects, she’d challenge herself to stay focused and work with efficiency to finish up before bedtime.

5. Keep Your Routine Intact on the Weekends

Saturday and Sunday are not the days to sleep in two or three hours — that can throw off your sleep routine. Come Sunday night, you won’t be tired for your normally appointed bedtime.

A half hour of sleep-in time on days off is reasonable, says Dimitriu.

6. Brush Your Teeth Early in the Evening

Consider this one a small hack that helps you avoid late night snacking. “Late night snacking keeps you up,” says Dimitriu. Not only can certain foods cause heartburn or contain caffeine that keeps you awake (like chocolate), but eating before bed can be taxing on your digestive system, which diminishes sleep quality, too.

7. Cut Yourself Off From Caffeine by Noon

You may have heard this unofficial rule before, but do you know why? Caffeine has a “half-life” of four to six hours, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). That’s how much time it takes for your body to metabolize half the caffeine. So, for some people, if they drink 20 ounces of coffee at noon, by 6 p.m., it’s as if 10 ounces is still in their system, says Dimitriu. While many people can drink coffee at night and have no problem, for most of us, having coffee in the later afternoon will cut into our sleep — and throw off this all-important sleep routine.";"(2019-12-13)

# FDA Watch: Monoclonal Antibody Treatments for COVID-19, Preventive Flu Medication, and an Anti-Nightmare Device Get Go-Ahead

FDA greenlights monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID-19. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been testing the safety and efficacy of using monoclonal antibodies to treat the novel coronavirus. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful antigens such as viruses.

On November 9, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab (made by Eli Lilly and Company) for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adult and pediatric patients. The FDA wrote that the most important evidence that bamlanivimab may be effective came from a study showing hospitalizations and emergency room visits occurred in 3 percent of bamlanivimab-treated patients on average compared with 10 percent in placebo-treated patients.

On November 21, the agency granted EUA to a monoclonal antibody combo of casirivimab and imdevimab to be administered together as a treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and children over the age of 12. Clinical trials found that these drugs (produced by Regeneron) taken together in an IV cocktail reduced hospitalization or emergency room visits related to COVID-19 in patients at high risk for disease progression within 28 days after treatment when compared with placebo. Patients received the duo of drugs within three days of testing positive.

COVID-19 home test gets the okay. The Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit has been authorized for emergency use for people who want to test themselves for the coronavirus at home. You collect a sample on a nasal swab, swirl it in a vial, then place the vial in the test unit. In 30 minutes or less, the results can be read directly from the test unit’s light-up display, indicating whether a person is positive or negative. Lucira anticipates its test will cost around $50. The product is not expected to reach the general public until early spring 2021 as the company steps up its manufacturing capabilities.

Flu medication can now be used as a preventive treatment. Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) from Genentech was originally approved in 2018 for treating uncomplicated flu in patients 12 years of age and older who have been exhibiting symptoms for no more than 48 hours. This month, the FDA gave the okay for the medication to be taken as a single-dose preventive treatment for those 12 and older who have been exposed to someone with the flu. “This expanded indication for Xofluza will provide an important option to help prevent influenza just in time for a flu season that is anticipated to be unlike any other because it will coincide with the coronavirus pandemic,” said Debra Birnkrant, MD, the director of the division of antiviral products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

Device to reduce nightmares moves forward. The FDA permitted marketing of a new device intended for the temporary reduction of sleep disturbance related to nightmares in adults 22 years or older who suffer from nightmare disorder or have nightmares from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The device issues a gentle vibration according to indications of heart rate and motion during sleep. The therapeutic tool, called Nightware, works with an Apple Watch and an Apple iPhone.

Drug for rare metabolic disorder gets thumbs-up. The first treatment for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), a rare genetic disorder that mainly affects the kidneys, has gained FDA approval. Developed under the coordination of the Oxalosis & Hyperoxaluria Foundation and the Kidney Health Initiative, the medication Oxlumo (lumasiran) helps decrease the production of oxalate, a substance that is overproduced in patients with PH1. An overabundance of oxalate can lead to progressive kidney damage, kidney failure, and the need for dialysis.

A first direct-to-tumor injection for dogs wins approval. The FDA gave the first approval for an intratumoral injection to treat nonmetastatic mast cell tumors in dogs. Tigilanol tiglate, sold under the brand name Stelfonta, is used to control tumors that most commonly form as nodules or masses under a dog’s skin — in particular areas of a dog’s leg.

FDA approves first treatment to reduce death in diseases that cause premature aging. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and progeroid laminopathies are genetic conditions characterized by the dramatic, rapid appearance of aging beginning in childhood. Most patients die before the age of 15 years from heart failure, heart attack, or stroke. On November 20, the FDA approved Zokinvy (lonafarnib) capsules to reduce the risk of death in patients one year and older who have these devastating conditions. This oral medication helps prevent the buildup of defective progerin or progerin-like protein, which can accumulate and trigger growth impairment.

Food Labeling and Recalls

Manufacturers encouraged to declare sesame as an ingredient. The FDA issued draft guidance this month recommending that food companies voluntarily list sesame on product labels when it is used as a “flavoring” or “spice” or when the common or usual name (such as tahini) does not specify sesame. The guidance is intended to help people who may have an allergic reaction to sesame, such as hives, vomiting, wheezing, or anaphylaxis (a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction). “Many Americans are allergic or sensitive to sesame, and they need the ability to quickly identify products that might contain sesame,” said Susan Mayne, PhD, the director of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, in a statement.

Allergy alert issued for Whole Foods popcorn chicken. Whole Foods Market is voluntarily recalling packaged popcorn chicken from 26 stores in Northern California and Nevada because the product may contain shrimp that was not listed on the product label. People who are allergic to shellfish could have a serious reaction if they consume the product. The item was labeled as “Popcorn Chicken Shaker with Sweet Chili,” with sell-by dates through November 27, 2020.

Romaine recalled. On November 21, Dole Fresh Vegetables Inc. voluntarily issued a recall of a limited number of cases of organic romaine hearts due to a possible E. coli bacteria risk. The specific products are Dole Organic Romaine Hearts (dated October 23 and 26) in a package of three with combined English/French labeling, and Wild Harvest Organic Romaine Hearts with the same dates.

Earlier in the month romaine from Tanimura & Antle (package date October 15 or 16) was also voluntarily recalled because of potential E. coli contamination.

Fresh Express also recalled a limited number of expired cases of Fresh Express Kit Caesar Supreme with the use-by date of November 8, 2020.

Dog food may pose salmonella risk. The health agency listed a voluntary recall on November 13 of 67 cases of Chicken Recipe for Dogs from Albright Raw Dog Food of Fort Wayne, Indiana, because the product may be contaminated with the bacteria salmonella.

Drug Recalls

Popular diabetes medication pulled due to potential carcinogenic impurity. At the beginning of the month, Nostrum Laboratories voluntarily removed from sale two lots of Metformin HCl Extended Release Tablets, USP 500 milligrams (mg), and two lots of Metformin HCl Extended Release Tablets, USP 750 mg. These batches of the widely used type 2 diabetes medication may contain excessive amounts of a cancer-causing compound called nitrosamine.

Prescription mouthwash may have bacterial contamination.

# Number 10 used apocalyptic Covid-19 graphs to 'frighten' public into lockdown, top statistician

Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter suggested Number 10 'frightened' the public into complying with lockdown rules

Number 10 cherry-picked 'spurious' coronavirus data to justify England's second lockdown and may have intended to frightened the public, according to one of Britain's top experts.

Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter said ministers had 'broken pretty much every code of conduct' by choosing only to show worst-case scenarios, which were often based on out of date data.

The Cambridge professor told MPs today: 'I don't want to ascribe motivation to anyone of course. But if someone was really trying to manipulate the audience and frighten them and persuade them that what was being done was correct, rather than genuinely inform them, then this is the kind of thing they might do.'

Doom-mongering graphs which predicted 50,000 cases by mid-October and 4,000 deaths a day by late November were used by Downing Street to justify England's second lockdown.

Those fantastical charts were widely ridiculed because the country was recording 14,000 daily infections last month and daily deaths currently average 441.

Speaking at a House of Commons select committee today, Professor Spiegelhalter added: 'Those projections were made by one team early in October under certain very pessimistic assumptions.

'They'd already been revised twice by the time they were shown to the public so it was completely inappropriate to present them to the public.

'I'm not saying the judgment [to decide to go into lockdown] was wrong, I'm not making any comment about that.

'What I'm objecting to strongly is the fact such spurious data and graphs were being presented to the public as a justification for the decisions that were being made.

'You didn't need that graph, you just needed quite short-term projections to tell something needed to be done or we could be in real trouble very quickly.

'There is good data available and yet at some point the need to persuade people, to instill a certain emotional reaction in people seems to take over at really quite a high level of decision making. I think it's quite unfortunate.'

Even Tory MPs compared the doomsday data used to justify the second lockdown to the controversial dossier that sent Britain to war with Iraq.

A graph projecting deaths hitting 4,000 per day by the end of December (blue line) was wheeled out at a Downing Street press conference last month announcing the second lockdown

The 4,000 deaths per day scenario was based on the assumption that there would be 1,000 per day by the start of November. There are on average 441 occurring across the UK as of November 23

The statistician was giving evidence to the House of Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee today.

He told MPs: 'I'm on record as having complained about what I call ""the number theatre"" of briefings in which big numbers were being thrown out, which seemed to be intended to give an effect favourable to politicians rather than genuinely trying to inform the public, who are sacrificing so much over this whole period.

'So just to come back to the important issue of trust… trustworthiness is the first pillar of the code of practice of statistics in this country.'

Professor Spiegelhalter was asked about the use of graphs and data in the hastily organised Downing Street press conference last month to announce the second lockdown.

Covid deaths rose steadily in November to take all-cause fatalities 19% above average – but the number is well below England's spring first wave which saw 21,000 people dying each week Covid deaths in England continued to rise in mid-November to 2,274 in the second week of the month, meaning deaths from all causes were 19 per cent higher than usual for the time of year. Office for National Statistics data published today shows there were 1,833 excess deaths in the week that ended November 13, with a total of 11,495 people dying. Although higher than average, the figure is only just over half the 21,157 deaths from all causes in England's worst week in April during the peak of the first wave — when Covid claimed around 8,000 lives. The number of people dying with the viral infection is now on par with those succumbing to flu or pneumonia for the first time since June. The coronavirus deaths recorded in the week that ended November 13 were a rise of 503 on the 1,771 recorded in the first week of the month. The data won't take into account any effects of lockdown because it can take infected patients several weeks to fall severely ill. Figures show that numbers of people dying of any cause is higher than average in all regions, with the northern parts of England still worst hit by Covid. In the North West, deaths are 38 per cent higher than usual, while in the South East they are only marginally higher at two per cent. Hospitals, care homes and private homes are all seeing more fatalities than they would expect to at this time of year, and one in five deaths are now linked to Covid-19, compared to one in six a week earlier. But the ONS data is backdated and known to be too old to reflect the current situation in the country. Department of Health death counts, which take in daily totals from hospitals and care homes for the whole UK, suggest that the number of people being killed by Covid-19 has started to level off after a surge in October. In the last three weeks of October, from the 10th to the 31st, the average number of people dying with coronavirus each day soared four-fold from 63 to 259, while in the first three weeks of November it rose far more slowly – by 57 per cent from 260 to 409. There are signs of a flattening in the trend, although experts have warned deaths will likely stay in the hundreds per day for weeks to come as the effects of huge numbers of infections in October and early November continue to trickle through.

He added: 'The communication on that Saturday was particularly poor, they were rushed into the briefing because somebody had leaked the main graph to the BBC the day before.

'This graph which claimed a projection of up to 4,000 deaths a day was widely ridiculed, and quite rightly.

'That was never intended for public communications it was out of date even at the time when it was released. It just shouldn't have been shown.

'I think what this shows is a real problem we've seen throughout the pandemic of the use of reasonable ""worst-case scenarios"" for public communication.'

Scientists modelling the pandemic to inform the Government produce three forecasts to give ministers a clearer idea of how the virus is spreading.

They use a best-case scenario and a worst-case scenario. Experts then take an average of the two to produce the third forecast.

Professor Spiegelhalter added: 'There is a role for those [worst-case scenario forecasts] – essentially for planning, how many body bags to buy etcetera – but three times I can think of [when they were misused].

'At the beginning we were told up to 500,000 deaths could occur, yeah, okay, if we did absolutely nothing.

'Then we had that graph, the famous one where cases were going to double every week and we'd end up with 49,000 by the end of October. In fact we had 14,000 by the end of October reported.

'That is not trustworthy communications, these are based on extreme assumptions that we just don't do anything.

'I don't want to ascribe motivation to anyone of course but if someone were really trying to manipulate the audience and frighten them and persuade them that what was being done was correct, rather than genuinely inform them, then this is the kind of thing they might do.

'Because no matter what you say about scenarios they will be interpreted as predictions.'

He said: 'Scenarios are fine, but when they're used in proper planning you have multiple scenarios you don't just produce one, you don't just produce the worst possible one, you show people the reasonable ones, optimistic ones, pessimistic ones, so you get an idea of the fan of possibilities and what sort of decisions might lead us into those different scenarios.

'And to just choose one to show it to people it breaks pretty much all the rules that I laid out earlier on.'

The data row comes as Royal Society scientists warned the UK does not have enough access to real-time statistics and by default relies on out of date figures.

The Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics (DELVE) said the Government should make better use of data gathered by private companies, as is done in other countries, rather than sticking with its centralised data gathering approach.

The report, Data Readiness: lessons from an Emergency, highlights how data such as aggregated and anonymised mobility and payment transaction data could be used to give a more accurate picture of the pandemic at national and local levels.

That could in turn lead to improvements in evaluation and better targeting of intervention, the group says, rather than crude approaches.

During the pandemic, counts of the daily flow of people from one place to another between more than 3,000 districts in Spain have been available at the click of a button.

This was based on a collaboration between the country's three main mobile phone operators.

It has allowed Spanish officials to have a deeper understanding how the movement of people contributes to the spread of the virus, DELVE claim.

Spain is one of the few European nations which avoided a second national lockdown, though transmission of the disease is still high.

Neil Lawrence, professor of machine learning at the University of Cambridge and an author of the report said: 'The UK has talked about making better use of data for the public good, but we have had statements of good intent, rather than action.

'We need to plan better for national emergencies. We need to look at the National Risk Register through the lens of what data would help us to respond more effectively.

'We have to learn our lessons from experiences in this pandemic and be better prepared for future crises. That means doing the work now to ensure that companies, the public sector and researchers have pathfinder projects up and running to share and analyse data and help the government to make better informed decisions.'

Professor Lawrence added: 'Mobile phone companies might provide a huge amount of anonymised and aggregated data that would allow us a much greater understanding of how people move around, potentially spreading the virus as they go.

'And there is a wealth of other data, such as from transport systems. The more we understand about this pandemic, the better we can tackle it.

'We should be able to work together, the private and the public sectors, to harness big data for massive positive social good and do that safely and responsibly.'";"(2020-05-16)

# Coronavirus UK: Sussex and Herefordshire cases soar as Tiers decided

Advertisement

An interactive module has today revealed how quickly coronavirus outbreaks are growing in every local authority in England as millions wait for Boris Johnson to declare which areas will be subject to Tier Three restrictions when the second national lockdown ends next week.

As Britain approached Autumn only five of around 200 local authorities had a weekly Covid-19 infection rate above 100 cases per 100,000 people. Only 24 areas still have an infection rate that is in the double figures.

East Sussex, Herefordshire and Milton Keynes were the local authorities in England that suffered the biggest spikes in coronavirus cases during the most recent week, making them among the most likely to enter Tier Three rules that force restaurants to move to takeaway only.

Public Health England statistics show infection rates — the number of new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people — shot up by at least 50 per cent in all three areas in the seven-day spell ending November 15. Kent, parts of Essex and London also saw large rises, according to the data MailOnline has used to make an interactive tool.

Meanwhile, the areas that saw the greatest falls in cases were almost all in Tier Three in the North West, adding further evidence that the local lockdown system appears to work. Warrington, Oldham, Wigan and Blackburn, all of which suffered huge numbers of infections during England's second wave, saw declines of 30 per cent or more.

Boris Johnson last night confirmed the country's second draconian lockdown will end on December 2, with No10 opting to return to a revamped three-tier system that could have to remain in place until at least March 31 — more than a year after the first lockdown began.

Ministers are waiting for the most up-to-date data to decide what brackets individual authorities will be placed in, with the breakdown set to be published on Thursday. Policymakers will analyse rates of infections, test positivity and speed of outbreak growth to decide on the measures.

The worst-hit areas including Hull and the North West are expected to be placed under the toughest Tier Three, which forces restaurants and pubs to shut — unless they offer takeaways.

Debate rages on over which bracket London should be in, with the capital's mayor Sadiq Khan predicting the city will face Tier Two — which bans mixing indoors with other households. But senior Tories including Sir Iain Duncan Smith last night demanded the city, the beating heart of the UK's economy, is put under Tier One.

Northern mayors have voiced opposition to plans to put them into higher tiers, with Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham saying they could trigger 'widespread business failure' in the region. MPs have warned T2 and T3 will be 'catastrophic' for businesses and spark a damaging new mutiny.

Whitehall sources told the Daily Mail last night that very few areas would be afforded Tier One restrictions, with only the rural regions — such as Cornwall and South Oxfordshire — likely to see the lightest rules applied.

Britain today recorded 11,299 Covid-19 cases in the lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks, but deaths rose again to 608 which is the highest toll since May.

‹ Slide me › Above are infections before winter in September (right) and those on November 18 (left) after the second lockdown

Covid-19 cases have fallen across most of the North of England since lockdown was imposed, but they are rising in a corner of the South East. The percentage change is based on comparing data from the week ending November 15 to the week ending November 8. It comes as the Government prepares to unveil its tier system

The onerous tiered system will be in place across England from December 3 until the end of March, the Prime Minister said

COVID RESTRICTIONS WILL BE EASED OVER CHRISTMAS FOR FIVE DAYS, OFFICIALS CONFIRM Coronavirus restrictions will be eased across the UK for five days at Christmas to allow up to three households to meet indoors after the four home nations agreed a joint plan to loosen draconian curbs over the festive period. A four-nation meeting of the Cobra emergency committee agreed the proposals this afternoon. The relaxed measures will be in place from Wednesday December 23 to Sunday December 27, paving the way for families in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to meet up. It came after Nicola Sturgeon had earlier suggested the Christmas respite from coronavirus lockdown would not be entirely the same in Scotland. The First Minister said she hoped there would be an agreement on a 'common framework' for the festive season. But she hinted at splits between the nations saying the 'precise definition of household' is likely to vary. Scotland currently has different rules on gatherings compared to England, including not including under-12s in limits on numbers. Meanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has admitted that loosening the restrictions over Christmas will inevitably lead to more cases of the deadly disease. Frantic efforts have been going on for days to find a joint position for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to allow some kind of family Christmas. Advertisement

Matt Hancock claims Tier Three restrictions before lockdown weren't enough to stop the virus;

Sir Jeremy Farrar, from the Wellcome Trust and a member of SAGE, said there was enough data for Britain to lockdown in January;

Today 11,299 Covid-19 cases were recorded in the lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks, but deaths rose to 608 in highest toll since May.

The Prime Minister warned last night: 'We expect more regions to fall, at least temporally, into higher levels than before but by using these tougher tiers and by using rapid turnaround tests on an ever greater scale to drive R below one.'

But he added the toughened tiers should make it possible for local authorities 'to move down the tier-ing scale to lower levels of restrictions' as cases start to plummet.

The previous system was heavily criticised for putting areas into Tier Three and then seemingly giving them no clear-cut way out of the curbs.

Toughest restrictions are likely to be applied to areas with the highest infection rates as well as those that have been growing the fastest in recent weeks.

Public Health England data shows a North-South divide that is seeing positive rates increasing faster in parts of the South of the country and in London, while rates are highest – but falling fastest – in the North.

This is likely a legacy of the original three-tier system which saw much of Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire thrust into the toughest local rules before the national lockdown while much of the South didn't have any at all.

North Lincolnshire was the only part of the country further north than the Midlands that featured in the top 20 places with the fastest rate of increase in the week up to November 15. The data counts positive test results that came through the Department of Health's official testing programme.

Ten of the top 20 were boroughs of London – Greenwich, Enfield, Merton, Croydon, Havering, Camden, Hammersmith & Fulham, Bromley, Kingston upon Thames and Hackney & the City of London.

Other areas that saw their positive case counts increase by 25 per cent or more in a week were East Sussex, Herefordshire, Milton Keynes, Kent, Medway, Southend-on-Sea, Slough, North Lincolnshire, Bedford and Cornwall.

Meanwhile, 17 out of the 20 areas that saw the biggest falls in their infection rates during the same week were all ones that were in Tier Three, with the exception only of Torbay in Devon, North East Lincolnshire and Derby.

Local authorities which had been in the toughest local rules before England's national lockdown on November 5 but then saw infections drop by 18 per cent or more in the second week of November were: St Helens, Wirral, Knowsley and Warrington in Merseyside; Manchester, Bury, Tameside, Rochdale, Trafford, Salford, Wigan and Oldham in Greater Manchester; and Doncaster, Sheffield, Nottingham and Blackburn with Darwen.

WHAT ARE THE NEW TIER RULES? Tier One will be the default and measures will not be allowed to get more relaxed in any part of England: Rule of six and social distancing apply to gatherings indoors and outdoors;

Pubs and restaurants are allowed to open with table service only and an 11pm closing time. Tier Two: People from separate households cannot meet indoors and the rule of six applies outside;

Pubs must close unless operating as restaurants, with alcoholic drinks served alongside meals; Tier Three will be the toughest level of restrictions and rules have been tightened up to make them stricter than before. All of the Tier Two rules apply as well as the following: Indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, theatres and bowling alleys must close;

Pubs, restaurants and cafes must close except for takeaway;

Shops and hairdressers and salons will be allowed to remain open;

Groups of six will be allowed to meet outdoors only;

Crowds at live events will be banned;

People should avoid travelling out of, or into, Tier Three areas unless it is unavoidable. Advertisement

Politicians and local leaders are today gathering to mount substantial challenges to the restrictions.

In the capital, Tory heavyweight Sir Iain has told the Telegraph that it 'must' be placed in Tier One to revive the country.

'London is dominant in the economy and we need it to get back to work immediately,' he said.

Another London MP told the Guardian they were 'fiercely lobbying' for pubs, bars and restaurants to be re-opened in the capital.

Sadiq Khan told LBC yesterday: 'It's a bit early to say yet, but based on the numbers that I've seen, which is a slowdown in the virus spreading, it's coming down in parts of London in a couple of boroughs.'

'What I hope would happen is... London would probably be in what is called Tier Two.'

None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures from the seven-day spell ending November 15, the latest date for which data is available.

But in 20 of the 32 boroughs the infection rate rose last week, with the biggest jumps in Havering, Enfield and Redbridge.

The highest infection rate is in Havering, in the north-east of the city, the only borough where they surged above 300 per 100,000.

The number of patients being rushed to hospital in the capital suffering from Covid-19 remains low, according to the Department of Health, at a seven-day average of 154.7 admissions on November 17. But this is far below the peak of the first wave, when on average 748 patients were being taken to hospital with Covid-19 every day.

These levels are also among the lowest in the country, which ministers are expected to argue mean that London can be spared the sharpest curbs on public freedoms.

Mayors in the North of England are also mounting opposition to yet again being placed under higher tiers, with Sheffield city leader Dan Jarvis warning: 'We're willing to do our bit, but we must not be taken for granted.'

Daily hospitalisation rates with Covid-19 across England Region North East&Yorks Midland North West London South East South West East of England Daily admissions 360.7 354.7 239.4 154.7 150.3 110.4 97.9 % change -8.2% -5.5% -14.8% +12.3% +9.5% -8.3% +6.1% This data is based on the latest figures from the Department of Health. Daily admissions is the seven-day average of admissions to November 17. And % change is based on the difference between the average on November 17 and November 10. Advertisement

He added: 'Tougher restrictions have had a massive impact on South Yorkshire's economy.

'The Government said it will return to its levelling up agenda after the pandemic, but the brutal reality is we cannot wait that long.

'At Wednesday's Spending Review, the Government has a golden opportunity to deliver on its promises.

'I've pressed Ministers to bring forward major investment, to give the North the best chance of weathering the storm, ensure businesses survive a tough winter and allow us to kick start the job of economic recovery and renewal.'

Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham has come out hard against being plunged into the toughest measures.

Mr Burnham said a toughened Tier Three 'could be devastating for the hospitality industry and will hit cities and the city economy very, very hard indeed'.

Across England Swale, in Kent, has the worst infection rate in the country at 631.7 per 100,000.

Local leaders there have spoken of their 'frustration' that residents appear not to be following restrictions, and taking simple precautions such as wearing a face mask.

Swale's council leader, Roger Truelove, said lockdown rules in the borough were being 'willfully disregarded', with residents regularly not wearing face coverings and ignoring social distancing.

An emergency council meeting was held yesterday to discuss why the district - which is home to about 150,000 and includes the Isle of Sheppey - has seen such rapid growth of the virus.

THERE WAS ENOUGH INFORMATION ON COVID-19 TO ACT IN JANUARY, SAYS SCIENTIST Enough was known about coronavirus in January to act straight away, but the response was delayed, a leading scientist has said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said that while information about the virus was 'uncertain', action could have been taken. At the start of January the World Health Organisation was aware of a cluster of pneumonia cases - with no deaths - in Wuhan, China, and shared detailed information with member states. Speaking at the Imperial College London's Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics's (J-IDEA) symposium on a post-Covid world, Sir Jeremy said the response to the information was delayed. He said: 'The information you have early may be uncertain, but it's enough to act on. 'I would say that at the end of January we knew enough to have acted. And we waited. 'We waited out of uncertainty, we wanted to be more certain than we needed to be. 'But by the end of January, we knew that this was able to transmit asymptomatically, that it caused a nasty clinical syndrome and a significant number of people were dying, that healthcare workers were getting sick and distant family members were getting sick when people moved from Wuhan to Sichuan, that this was going out of China into other parts of south-east Asia, that we had no diagnostics, no treatment and no vaccines. 'To me, at the time - and this is not in retrospect - I think that was enough to have acted then in ways that we delayed.' Advertisement

The latest analysis of PHE figures, by the Press Association news agency, found Covid-19 case rates started to fall in most local areas across England in the most recent week, up to November 15.

Only two of nine regions - London and the South East - are still recording week-on-week rises in cases. The full impact of England's second national lockdown, however, is yet to become apparent in the data.

It takes up to two weeks for someone who has caught the virus to show symptoms, get tested, and receive a positive result. This means that many infections currently being reported may have occurred before the emergency measures were brought in.

But the latest figures suggest the numbers are heading in the right direction, though not in all parts of England.

The nationwide restrictions began on November 5, and the most recent figures are for the week ending November 15 – just 14 days into the lockdown.

Infection surges were recorded in 34 out of 67 local authorities in the South East, with Medway seeing the biggest jump.

Medway, in Kent, had the sixth biggest surge in infections in the country when they rose by 39.3 per cent to 299 per 100,000.

But the biggest week-on-week falls were recorded in the North West - signalling that earlier measures were helping to drive down cases alongside the lockdown.

Warrington saw the biggest fall in England, where infections dropped by 32.5 per cent to 259.6 per 100,000.

It was followed by Oldham, in Greater Manchester, where infections fell by 30.7 per cent to 519.2 per 100,000.

And Wigan saw the third biggest fall with a 30.3 per cent drop to 403.2 per 100,000.

When the tiered system returns on December 3, they will be reviewed every two weeks to establish whether local authorities need to have stricter curbs imposed or can be dropped to lower restrictions.

It is set to be in place until March 31, at which point the tiered system will come to an end.

Boris Johnson said last night that he hoped the country would be able to get back to normal 'by Easter', predicting this could be when the elderly and most vulnerable members of the population will have received a Covid-19 vaccine.

Three vaccines - including Oxford's jab - have said they are at least 70 per cent effective at triggering an immune response, prompting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to say 'the end of the tunnel' of the pandemic is in sight.

GRANT SHAPPS URGES BRITONS NOT TO USE TRAINS AT CHRISTMAS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE TOO BUSY Grant Shapps today urged Britons not to use trains at Christmas because they will be 'too busy' - as UK ministers meet to thrash out a plan to ease coronavirus rules so family reunions can happen. An announcement is imminent on proposals for a loosening over the festive season, with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove due to chair a Cobra meeting with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But the Transport Secretary has warned that the rail network's 'limitations', with major engineering work and capacity constraints, mean people should avoid using it where possible. In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Shapps said: 'We are going to be appealing to people to look very carefully at the transport route they take and of course even making a choice about whether they travel at all.' News on how restrictions on socialising will be relaxed for a few days - probably from December 23-27 - had been expected today, but might now come later in the week, as sources say 'details need ironing out'. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there could be a 'slight and careful' easing of the rules for a few days while Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething has suggested tough measures to control the virus before Christmas could allow 'more headroom for the festive season'. Mr Gove is set to chair a meeting with the devolved administrations later, in a bid to get the package over the line. Advertisement

The UK has ordered 100million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, with up to four million set to arrive this year. It is also expecting the first part of a delivery of 40million doses from Pfizer and BioNtech - who say their vaccine is 90 per cent effective - by the end of the year, and five million doses from Moderna - with a 94.5 per cent effective shot - in the spring next year.

Leaked NHS plans reveal they could start vaccinating the elderly and most vulnerable against the virus in early December, with vaccines being rolled out to the rest of the population in the new year.

But scientists have urged caution, warning none of the jabs have yet been approved for use by the UK's regulator the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The regulator reviews data on vaccine effectiveness and how safe it is before deciding whether or not to allow it to be administered across the country. It is a process that usually takes two years but, amid pressure to get life back to normal, the regulator has said it is working hard to make a decision quickly.

The Prime Minister detailed his winter strategy yesterday, with a plan to deploy a major testing scheme in an attempt to win over rebels on the Conservative backbenches.

He told tell MPs that non-essential shops can open in all three tiers after the current restrictions expire on December 2, in a boost for retailers.

Mr Johnson also set out the basis of plans to allow a small number of households across the UK to mix over a limited number of days around Christmas.

Vaccines and tiers – all your questions answered

When are we coming out of national lockdown?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the national lockdown imposed on November 5 will come to an end on December 2.

However, England will then move back into a regional tiered system of restrictions – similar to those introduced earlier this year.

What is the tier system?

There are three different tiers of restrictions, which will be imposed at a regional level depending on the number of coronavirus cases in that area.

Those living under Tier 1 restrictions will have the greatest freedoms, while people in Tiers 2 and 3 will face stricter measures.

Official testing data shows that coronavirus infection rates are falling across the North of England, where they were highest during the peak of the second wave, but they remain high in some areas of the West Midlands, Kent, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire (Darker colours indicate higher rates of positive tests per 100,000 people)

LONDON LOCKDOWN REVOLT: MPS WARN PUTTING CAPITAL IN T3 WOULD BE A 'DISASTER' In 20 of London's 32 regions last week there were increases in infection rates. The biggest jumps being Havering (up from 309.4 to 386.0), Enfield (up from 175.6 to 230.4) and Redbridge (up from 249.0 to 300.4) Boris Johnson has been warned by furious London Tories that it would be an economic 'disaster' if the capital was hit with the toughest possible coronavirus restrictions after lockdown ends. City MPs and the Conservative candidate for mayor, Shaun Bailey, sent the Prime Minister a clear warning after it emerged officials could place the metropolis into the top Tier 3 after December 2. They warned such a move could cripple London's entertainment and hospitality industries, with pubs and restaurants open for takeaway and delivery sales only and theatres and other venues remaining closed. None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures. But speaking to business leaders via Zoom last night, Mr Bailey said: 'I absolutely agree it would be a disaster for London if we were in Tier 3. Advertisement

How will they decide on what tier to introduce?

Regions with high numbers of cases will face tighter measures, while those with fewer cases will have their restrictions relaxed.

To decide which tier to apply to a specific area, officials will look at coronavirus cases across all age groups, and specifically among the over-60s who are considered most at risk.

They will also consider whether infection rates are rising or falling and the prevalence of the disease per 100,000 of the population.

When will I find out what tier I'm in?

An announcement will be made on Thursday.

What is allowed under each tier?

Under Tier 1, people can meet a maximum of six friends or family outdoors or indoors.

Pubs and restaurants can reopen, but with table service only and an 11pm closing time.

In Tier 2, people from two different households cannot mix indoors, and outdoor gatherings will be limited to six.

Pubs will remain closed unless operating as restaurants, with alcohol only served as part of a 'substantial meal'.

Retail and personal care – such as hairdressers and beauty salons – can reopen in all tiers, and indoor entertainment venues – such as cinemas, theatres, bowling alleys and casinos – will be allowed to stay open in Tiers 1 and 2, but not Tier 3.

Tier 3 areas will see the hospitality sector remain closed except for takeaways, and groups of six will only be able to meet in outdoor public spaces.

Can I travel between tiers?

People in Tier 3 areas should avoid travelling to other parts of the UK, including for overnight stays unless it is for work, education, health or care requirements.

Likewise, those in Tier 1 and 2 areas should not travel to Tier 3 zones, but can pass through them as part of a longer journey.

Should I start making plans for Christmas?

Not just yet. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was unable to confirm on Monday any details as to how people would be able to spend the festive period.

However, a plan to allow families to be reunited for Christmas is being developed with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

HANCOCK CLAIMS T3 WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH BEFORE LOCKDOWN Matt Hancock has claimed Tier Three restrictions imposed before lockdown were not tough enough to halt the spread of Covid-19, and revealed he hopes damaging restrictions on Britons lives will be lifted after Easter. Speaking to Parliament's Health and Social Care Committee, the 'architect' of the tiered system said he was convinced a second lockdown was needed when cases suddenly surged in all areas of England. The then-spiralling numbers, he said, meant that 'even in the lower prevalence areas you could see they were going to get to high prevalence if we didn't act'. Public Health England data reveals the sharpest spike in infections across England was in the week ending October 4, when almost every local authority saw Covid-19 infections surge by more than 50 per cent. Ministers then rushed out the tiered system - which came into force on October 14 - in an attempt to suppress escalating cases. But just 23 days later - and amid growing evidence that Tier Three was driving down infections - they hit the nuclear button and imposed a second nationwide lockdown. The Health Secretary and Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove are thought to have been the main supporters of the stringent measures in the cabinet. Mr Hancock appeared today in front of the committee to answer questions on the Government's handling of the pandemic, including whether Test and Trace is working, whether the first lockdown was imposed early enough and why a circuit breaker was avoided. Boris Johnson yesterday unveiled his beefed-up tier system, with Tier Three now forcing all restaurants and bars to shift to take-away only. Advertisement

Is there a vaccine yet?

Not quite. Although vaccine developers have started to publish the interim results from their trials, which have so far been positive.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca team announced its vaccine had proved up to 90% effective.

When will it be ready?

No one can be certain at this stage as no vaccine has been approved for use yet.

But the jab is likely to be rolled out in the UK from December, with the bulk of vaccination in the new year.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, if all goes well in the next couple of weeks, the vaccination programme could potentially be rolled out from next month for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.

Will I have to pay for a jab?

No, the vaccine will be free on the NHS.

Will there be enough for everyone?

The Government said it has secured access to more than 350 million doses of vaccine from seven developers between now and the end of 2021, which is enough to potentially vaccinate the whole population.

Do I have to get a vaccine?

There are no plans to make vaccination compulsory, Downing Street said earlier in November.

However, Mr Hancock has also refused to rule out making it mandatory.

How long will immunity last?

The Government said in its Covid Winter Plan that the exact strength and duration of immunity provided through vaccination is not yet known.

Protection through vaccination takes time to build and requires a full course, but it is still unknown how well the first vaccines will stop the virus from passing between people.

Can I choose what vaccine I get?

As things stand, the vaccines will be rolled out as and when they become available, depending on which are approved first and how quickly companies can make them.

No announcement has been made on whether one might be given priority over another as they become ready on a mass scale.

People are not expected to be able to choose which jab they want to receive.

When will life return to normal?

While it is not known exactly how long it might take for the population to be vaccinated, Mr Hancock has said it is looking as though things may start returning to normal after Easter.

But until then, and until there is some kind of herd immunity in the population, achieved through vaccination, people will need to continue to wear face masks, socially distance and wash their hands.";"(2020-11-14)

# Tennessee, Texas Among Guinea Pigs for New COVID Vaccine

Have you been surprised or scared by the rapid rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine? If so, you’re not alone. The promise of a COVID-19 vaccine is materializing at a breakneck speed. As Pfizer prepares for the release of their new COVID-19 vaccine, 4 states have been selected as mass testing sites for the unproven inoculation. Chief among them is my home state of Tennessee, where Governor Bill Lee has held meetings with vaccine czar Bill Gates. In an industry already protected from legal repercussions and exempt from standard safety testing, this new vaccine ushers in a new era of danger.
With one of the shortest testing periods on record and a middling amount of data that would be laughed out of any other study, the vaccine is set to be released in four states: Tennessee, Texas, Rhode Island, and New Mexico. This vaccine will be dangerous, government leaders are being pressured and influenced by outside parties, and the nation is already preparing to make this vaccine mandatory. 
Pfizer’s COVID Vaccine is Untested and Dangerous
First, it’s important to understand that vaccine developers play by a different set of rules than the rest of the pharmaceutical industry. Most pharmaceutical trials require months – if not years – of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. But because the industries making a profit insist that vaccines are essential to the health of children, they’ve been shielded from ever conducting studies in a manner that the scientific community demands in any other circumstance. 
Meanwhile, the “standards” for vaccine safety are set by previously released, untested vaccines. So new vaccines are tested against existing vaccines to see if they’re more dangerous. It’s like letting your children play with a wild bear because it’s not as dangerous as a tiger. The logic is absurd. 
In fact, the testing periods are so short that many adverse effects couldn’t possibly be documented in time to be reflected in the study results. Take the hot-button issue of autism. Vaccine manufacturers swear that vaccines don’t cause autism, but autism spectrum disorders often take years to develop. Of course a safety testing period of only a few days won’t reflect the long-term damage these injections can cause. 
When it comes to COVID-19 vaccines, companies completely skipped animal testing and went straight to human trials – something UNHEARD OF in modern medicine. But that issue is even worse now that companies are emboldened by the COVID-19 “crisis.” 
In the UK, emergency requests for new AI were submitted to handle what is expected to be an “overwhelming” number of reported adverse effects from the vaccine. Nations are actively preparing for this vaccine to cause harm, and yet the Big Pharma train keeps on rolling. 
Pfizer boasts that their new vaccine is 95% effective at stopping the virus… but there are a lot of problems with that number. First, the amount of safety data available barely registers on a statistical level. Pfizer is asking the corrupt FDA for an “emergency authorization” to start administering the vaccine within days. 
Second, the study completely ignored people who have already been sick or tested positive for the virus. This means that they have absolutely NO CLUE what would happen if they administered the vaccine to someone who has already contracted the virus. And with hundreds of thousands of people untested, it would be nearly impossible to administer the vaccine on a global scale without injecting people who had already had the virus, whether they were asymptomatic or simply never went to a doctor.
Third, this is just ONE study that has yet to be peer reviewed or duplicated. Normally, a study must be peer-reviewed before being published. Oftentimes, these studies are sent back for more complete research before being accepted by a medical publication. Additionally, virtually no one has had a chance to replicate the study. There are simply too many variables and not nearly enough data for any sane person to declare that this vaccine is safe or effective. 
However, Pfizer is planning to roll it out all the same, and their stock value has gone up while the shares of rival vaccine manufacturer Moderna took a nosedive. And money is just one of the reasons that this vaccine is being rushed past any kind of reasonable safety protocols. The other is power. 
Which brings us to Bill Gates…
Is Money Influencing Government Leaders?
Here at TTAC, we’ve discussed Bill Gates in depth  (here, here, and here, for example), but what we haven’t yet covered is his cozy relationship with our state of Tennessee. Ever the generous philanthropist, Gates has spent an inordinate amount of time and resources “investing” in Tennessee… especially the school system. Earlier this year, Gates visited local schools to talk about his plan to improve the state’s education. Not to mention the many visits between Bill Gates and Tennessee’s governor, Bill Lee.
Now, the state is scheduled to be one of the first locations for mass administration of this completely untested vaccine. According to Reuters, Pfizer chose Tennessee because of its “immunization infrastructure,” which Governor Lee confirmed in a tweet this week.  
“Pfizer selected our state because of our ability to build out a strong infrastructure and we are thankful for their partnership,” he gushed. 
It may not be a coincidence that Pfizer chose Tennessee for the early pilot program. Competing manufacturer Moderna has developed a vaccine in partnership with researchers at Vanderbilt, Emory University, the National Institutes of Health, and others. Vanderbilt’s research is funded in part by Tennessee’s own Dolly Parton, who donated $1 million to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s COVID-19 research fund.
Moderna’s vaccine is expected to be available 7 to 10 days AFTER Pfizer’s product hits the market. [But we’re supposed to believe that everyone is “in this together” to find a cure for COVID, right?]
During a recent news conference, Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey said that Tennessee will be ready to distribute vaccines on Dec. 1, although it’s not yet clear when vaccine doses will be approved and distributed to other states.
Once the FDA receives information from vaccine developers, it could take several days to a few weeks for the vaccines to be approved, Piercey said. After approval, vaccines may begin to be distributed in as little as 24 hours. Tennessee does not plan to require additional approval of vaccines at the state level once the FDA has approved vaccines for distribution to states, she added. 
That’s right. 
Tennessee plans to green light an extremely experimental drug with absolutely no further testing or approval processes. 
Is it possible that governor Bill Lee cut a deal with Pfizer or Gates to help them be first to market their new shot? We know that Gates spent a considerable amount of time (and money) in Tennessee over the past few months. And Lee has been more than willing to exercise dictatorial authority in response to the virus. 
We reached out to his office to ask about financial ties or other funding provided by Pfizer or Gates, but were told by his office that he was unavailable for comment. 
Tennessee unveiled its initial vaccine distribution plan on Oct. 21, establishing a draft hierarchy for who gets the vaccine during three phases of availability. At the time, state officials said they did not yet know which vaccines the state will receive, how many doses are coming or when those doses will arrive for distribution.
“This initially will not be widely available,” Piercey said Tuesday, adding that widespread availability is not anticipated until spring of 2021.
The plan states that 85% of Tennessee’s vaccines will be distributed across its 95 counties based on population, 5% of Tennessee’s doses will be distributed equitably across the 95 counties regardless of population and disease burden, and 10% will be retained by the state for potential unanticipated priority needs.
The plan’s first phrase prioritizes the first doses for first responders and front line health care workers. Tennesseans with illnesses that put them at high risk of virus complications, older individuals with high-risk illnesses and those in congregate care facilities will also receive priority.
In a second phase, Tennessee will prioritize vaccination for staff in schools and childcare businesses, as well as older adults with “medium-risk” illnesses and workers in “critical infrastructure” industries. The third and final phase would include children, young adults, others in congregate care settings, and, eventually, everyone else. And that plan extends beyond Tennessee.
It’s worth mentioning, however, that there are still some government leaders resisting the push for mandatory vaccinations. In Texas, Governor Greg Abbott made it abundantly clear that this vaccine will be optional for all citizens.
The Nation is Preparing for Mandatory Vaccinations
The mass COVID hysteria is all leading up to one thing: forced vaccinations. Our schools and businesses have been closed, hunger and depression have skyrocketed, and some government agencies are already planning to withhold food stamps and other social safety nets for anyone who doesn’t get in line for a shot. 
In New York City, public schools were just closed again, with no clear plan for reopening. What are the odds that children won’t be allowed back in school without the new COVID vaccine coursing through their bodies? 
The odds are pretty good, especially in New York. Just last year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency due to the increased incidence of measles in Brooklyn. The reported cases of measles have been primarily limited to the Orthodox Jewish community in Williamsburg, a neighborhood in Brooklyn. According to Reuters, anyone who has not received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine will face a fine up to $1,000.
“It was time to take a more muscular approach. The faster everyone heeds the order, the faster we can lift it,” said de Blasio. But lifting a mandate only once everyone has complied hardly equates to freedom. And this is hardly an isolated incident. 
Just this afternoon, Pretender-Elect Joe Biden held a press conference in which he stressed the importance of getting a COVID-19 vaccine ready. “We need to get this into all 330 million Americans,” he said. 
And he may have military backing.

Check out this clip (shared by our good friend Erin Elizabeth) where General Gustave Perna explains Operation Warp Speed:

https://cdn.thetruthaboutcancer.com/wp-content/uploads/20201124173221/Military-Vax.mp4
In the partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense, General Perna makes it clear that all of America MUST receive the vaccine within 24 hours.

WHAT?!?
Ever since this virus appeared, governments and corporations have been making a run for it with our freedoms and our money. Remember that stimulus check a few months back? Hundreds of billions of dollars went to big corporations. Your tax dollars. Meanwhile, we can’t go to a grocery store or walk through an airport without being accosted about wearing a mask.
We expected the government to negotiate with bargaining chips that aren’t theirs to begin with. They’ve been trying to hold public education hostage for years. Now they’ve got small businesses between a rock and a hard place. Thousands of children are starving to death every month because of the lockdowns imposed without proper approval by state and local legislatures. Domestic violence, drug abuse, and suicide are skyrocketing. 
Maybe you wear a mask because you need to buy groceries for your family. Maybe you open your business at 30% capacity for fear of being shut down. Maybe you’ve missed weddings, funerals, births, and holidays because of these extreme travel restrictions.
But the stakes just got higher. We have generals talking about requiring every American to get vaccinated. We have manufacturers skipping over even the most basic safety protocols. We have Joe Biden on live television telling us that vaccinating every American is our top priority. 
We’ve been told that we must all get this dangerous new shot in order to get our lives back. They want to force me and my children to be injected with an experimental new drug just so we can buy food or go to church?
Over my dead body.";"(2019-12-13)

# Anxiety Associated With Faster Alzheimer’s Disease Onset

Summary: Anxiety may accelerate the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. Brain scans revealed patients who progressed from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease had decreased volume in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

Source: RSNA

Anxiety is associated with an increased rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study being presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Alzheimer’s disease represents a major public health crisis worldwide. The number of deaths from the disease has more than doubled since 2000, and it is currently the fifth-leading cause of death among individuals over 65 in the U.S.

Many people with Alzheimer’s disease first suffer from mild cognitive impairment, a decline in cognitive abilities like memory and thinking skills that is more rapid than normally associated with aging. Anxiety has been frequently observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment, although its role in disease progression is not well understood.

“We know that volume loss in certain areas of the brain is a factor that predicts progression to Alzheimer’s disease,” said study senior author Maria Vittoria Spampinato, M.D., professor of radiology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston. “In this study, we wanted to see if anxiety had an effect on brain structure, or if the effect of anxiety was independent from brain structure in favoring the progression of disease.”

The study group included 339 patients, average age of 72 years, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 cohort. Each person had a baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment; 72 progressed to Alzheimer’s disease while 267 remained stable.

The researchers obtained brain MRIs to determine the baseline volumes of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, two areas important to forming memories. They also tested for the presence of the ApoE4 allele, the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Anxiety was measured with established clinical surveys.

As expected, patients who progressed to Alzheimer’s disease had significantly lower volumes in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex and greater frequency of the ApoE4 allele. Most notably though, the researchers found that anxiety was independently associated with cognitive decline.

“Mild cognitive impairment patients with anxiety symptoms developed Alzheimer’s disease faster than individuals without anxiety, independently of whether they had a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease or brain volume loss,” said study first author Jenny L. Ulber, a medical student at MUSC.

The link between anxiety symptoms and a faster progression to Alzheimer’s disease presents an opportunity for improving the screening and management of patients with early mild cognitive impairment, the researchers said.

“We need to better understand the association between anxiety disorders and cognitive decline,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We don’t know yet if the anxiety is a symptom–in other words, their memory is getting worse and they become anxious–or if anxiety contributes to cognitive decline. If we were able in the future to find that anxiety is actually causing progression, then we should more aggressively screen for anxiety disorders in the elderly.”

Brain MRI of a 72-year-old woman shows loss of volume of the hippocampus (arrows). The patient had all three characteristics, volume loss of the hippocampi, APOE4, and anxiety, found in the study to be associated with progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Credit: RSNA

“The geriatric population is routinely screened for depression in many hospitals, but perhaps this vulnerable population should also be assessed for anxiety disorders,” Ulber added. “Middle-aged and elderly individuals with high level of anxiety may benefit from intervention, whether it be pharmacological or cognitive behavioral therapy, with the goal of slowing cognitive decline.”

The study was based on MRI scans done at one point in time. For future research, the team would like to study MRIs obtained after the initial scan to better understand the connection between anxiety and brain structure.

“We’re now interested in looking at changes over time to see if anxiety has an effect one way or the other on how fast the brain damage progresses,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We will also take a closer look at gender differences in the association between anxiety and cognitive decline.”

# COVID Vaccine Might Spur Some Sickness

By Ernie Mundell HealthDay Reporter

TUESDAY, Nov. 24, 2020 – At least three new COVID-19 vaccine candidates are already in the pipeline, will a roll-out expected early in the new year. But on Monday, experts attending a meeting of an advisory committee to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stressed that Americans who get a shot shouldn't be surprised if they feel under the weather for a few days afterwards.

""These are immune responses, so if you feel something after vaccination, you should expect to feel that. And when you do, it's normal that you have some arm soreness or some fatigue or some body aches or even some fever,"" Patricia Stinchfield of Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, told the meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. She represents the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, and said providers must be ready to explain this to people who line up to get any COVID-19 vaccine.

Vaccines work to fight disease by producing an immune response within the body. And sometimes that means flu-like symptoms, such as aches, headache and fever.

Already, some volunteers in trials of candidate vaccines from drug companies Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca have reported flu-like symptoms after immunization. And experts worry that those reports might keep people away from vaccination, or from required second doses.

The CDC's Dr. Sara Oliver told the committee during the five-hour-long meeting that, depending on the survey, anywhere between 40% and 80% of Americans say they'd be willing to get vaccinated.

Dr. Paul Hunter, of the city of Milwaukee health department and a voting member of the committee, said the testimonials of the first batches of people who get a COVID-19 vaccine could be crucial to wider acceptance.

""The people who highly value getting the vaccine soon and fast, early, are going to be really helpful to everyone else. And I think we really are going to need to honor them, because they are going to let us know how it feels,"" he told the committee. ""And I think these people are likely to be health care workers who are likely to be up for that kind of task.""

Another vaccine candidate

Americans were greeted with a possible advance against coronavirus as Thanksgiving week began: A third vaccine candidate shows good results in shielding recipients against the virus.

Meanwhile, U.S. coronavirus cases continued to explode: More than 179,000 new cases were recorded on Monday, with more than 12.4 million Americans now known to be infected.

Hopes for the roll-out of another effective vaccine brightened on Monday, however. Drug giant AstraZeneca announcing that late-stage clinical trials of its coronavirus shot showed it to be 70.4% effective, The New York Times reported.

The trials were conducted in the United Kingdom and Brazil in collaboration with the University of Oxford. The AstraZeneca vaccine becomes the third shot to show good effectiveness, following on the heels of promising data on vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. Both of the latter two shots had effectiveness around 95%.

The AstraZeneca results were based on the results of two dosing regimens for the vaccine: One regimen showed an effectiveness of 62%, the company said, while the other showed a 90% effectiveness.

The regimen showing a 90% effectiveness involved a first dose given at half strength and a second dose given at standard strength. No severe cases of COVID-19 emerged among any recipients, and there was a reduction in asymptomatic infections, suggesting that the vaccine was reducing transmission of the virus, AstraZeneca said.

Worsening spread

In the meantime, the new coronavirus is spreading across America with unprecedented speed, the White House Coronavirus Task Force said in its first briefing in four months on Thursday.

""This is more cases, more rapidly, than what we had seen before,"" Dr. Deborah Birx said during the briefing. ""You can see the increase in test positivity to around 10%."" That's the number of people tested who get a positive diagnosis.

# Coronavirus UK: Sussex and Herefordshire cases soar as Tiers decided

Advertisement

An interactive module has today revealed how quickly coronavirus outbreaks are growing in every local authority in England as millions wait for Boris Johnson to declare which areas will be subject to Tier Three restrictions when the second national lockdown ends next week.

As Britain approached Autumn only five of around 200 local authorities had a weekly Covid-19 infection rate above 100 cases per 100,000 people. Only 24 areas still have an infection rate that is in the double figures.

East Sussex, Herefordshire and Milton Keynes were the local authorities in England that suffered the biggest spikes in coronavirus cases during the most recent week, making them among the most likely to enter Tier Three rules that force restaurants to move to takeaway only.

Public Health England statistics show infection rates — the number of new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people — shot up by at least 50 per cent in all three areas in the seven-day spell ending November 15. Kent, parts of Essex and London also saw large rises, according to the data MailOnline has used to make an interactive tool.

Meanwhile, the areas that saw the greatest falls in cases were almost all in Tier Three in the North West, adding further evidence that the local lockdown system appears to work. Warrington, Oldham, Wigan and Blackburn, all of which suffered huge numbers of infections during England's second wave, saw declines of 30 per cent or more.

Boris Johnson last night confirmed the country's second draconian lockdown will end on December 2, with No10 opting to return to a revamped three-tier system that could have to remain in place until at least March 31 — more than a year after the first lockdown began.

Ministers are waiting for the most up-to-date data to decide what brackets individual authorities will be placed in, with the breakdown set to be published on Thursday. Policymakers will analyse rates of infections, test positivity and speed of outbreak growth to decide on the measures.

The worst-hit areas including Hull and the North West are expected to be placed under the toughest Tier Three, which forces restaurants and pubs to shut — unless they offer takeaways.

Debate rages on over which bracket London should be in, with the capital's mayor Sadiq Khan predicting the city will face Tier Two — which bans mixing indoors with other households. But senior Tories including Sir Iain Duncan Smith last night demanded the city, the beating heart of the UK's economy, is put under Tier One.

Northern mayors have voiced opposition to plans to put them into higher tiers, with Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham saying they could trigger 'widespread business failure' in the region. MPs have warned T2 and T3 will be 'catastrophic' for businesses and spark a damaging new mutiny.

Whitehall sources told the Daily Mail last night that very few areas would be afforded Tier One restrictions, with only the rural regions — such as Cornwall and South Oxfordshire — likely to see the lightest rules applied.

Britain today recorded 11,299 Covid-19 cases in the lowest daily figure for almost eight weeks, but deaths rose again to 608 which is the highest toll since May.

‹ Slide me › Above are infections before winter in September (right) and those on November 18 (left) after the second lockdown

Covid-19 cases have fallen across most of the North of England since lockdown was imposed, but they are rising in a corner of the South East. The percentage change is based on comparing data from the week ending November 15 to the week ending November 8. It comes as the Government prepares to unveil its tier system

The onerous tiered system will be in place across England from December 3 until the end of March, the Prime Minister said

COVID RESTRICTIONS WILL BE EASED OVER CHRISTMAS FOR FIVE DAYS, OFFICIALS CONFIRM Coronavirus restrictions will be eased across the UK for five days at Christmas to allow up to three households to meet indoors after the four home nations agreed a joint plan to loosen draconian curbs over the festive period. A four-nation meeting of the Cobra emergency committee agreed the proposals this afternoon. The relaxed measures will be in place from Wednesday December 23 to Sunday December 27, paving the way for families in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to meet up. It came after Nicola Sturgeon had earlier suggested the Christmas respite from coronavirus lockdown would not be entirely the same in Scotland. The First Minister said she hoped there would be an agreement on a 'common framework' for the festive season. But she hinted at splits between the nations saying the 'precise definition of household' is likely to vary. Scotland currently has different rules on gatherings compared to England, including not including under-12s in limits on numbers. Meanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has admitted that loosening the restrictions over Christmas will inevitably lead to more cases of the deadly disease. Frantic efforts have been going on for days to find a joint position for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to allow some kind of family Christmas. Advertisement

The Prime Minister warned last night: 'We expect more regions to fall, at least temporally, into higher levels than before but by using these tougher tiers and by using rapid turnaround tests on an ever greater scale to drive R below one.'

But he added the toughened tiers should make it possible for local authorities 'to move down the tier-ing scale to lower levels of restrictions' as cases start to plummet.

The previous system was heavily criticised for putting areas into Tier Three and then seemingly giving them no clear-cut way out of the curbs.

Toughest restrictions are likely to be applied to areas with the highest infection rates as well as those that have been growing the fastest in recent weeks.

Public Health England data shows a North-South divide that is seeing positive rates increasing faster in parts of the South of the country and in London, while rates are highest – but falling fastest – in the North.

This is likely a legacy of the original three-tier system which saw much of Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire thrust into the toughest local rules before the national lockdown while much of the South didn't have any at all.

North Lincolnshire was the only part of the country further north than the Midlands that featured in the top 20 places with the fastest rate of increase in the week up to November 15. The data counts positive test results that came through the Department of Health's official testing programme.

Ten of the top 20 were boroughs of London – Greenwich, Enfield, Merton, Croydon, Havering, Camden, Hammersmith & Fulham, Bromley, Kingston upon Thames and Hackney & the City of London.

Other areas that saw their positive case counts increase by 25 per cent or more in a week were East Sussex, Herefordshire, Milton Keynes, Kent, Medway, Southend-on-Sea, Slough, North Lincolnshire, Bedford and Cornwall.

Meanwhile, 17 out of the 20 areas that saw the biggest falls in their infection rates during the same week were all ones that were in Tier Three, with the exception only of Torbay in Devon, North East Lincolnshire and Derby.

Local authorities which had been in the toughest local rules before England's national lockdown on November 5 but then saw infections drop by 18 per cent or more in the second week of November were: St Helens, Wirral, Knowsley and Warrington in Merseyside; Manchester, Bury, Tameside, Rochdale, Trafford, Salford, Wigan and Oldham in Greater Manchester; and Doncaster, Sheffield, Nottingham and Blackburn with Darwen.

WHAT ARE THE NEW TIER RULES? Tier One will be the default and measures will not be allowed to get more relaxed in any part of England: Rule of six and social distancing apply to gatherings indoors and outdoors;

Pubs and restaurants are allowed to open with table service only and an 11pm closing time. Tier Two: People from separate households cannot meet indoors and the rule of six applies outside;

Pubs must close unless operating as restaurants, with alcoholic drinks served alongside meals; Tier Three will be the toughest level of restrictions and rules have been tightened up to make them stricter than before. All of the Tier Two rules apply as well as the following: Indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, theatres and bowling alleys must close;

Pubs, restaurants and cafes must close except for takeaway;

Shops and hairdressers and salons will be allowed to remain open;

Groups of six will be allowed to meet outdoors only;

Crowds at live events will be banned;

People should avoid travelling out of, or into, Tier Three areas unless it is unavoidable. Advertisement

Politicians and local leaders are today gathering to mount substantial challenges to the restrictions.

In the capital, Tory heavyweight Sir Iain has told the Telegraph that it 'must' be placed in Tier One to revive the country.

'London is dominant in the economy and we need it to get back to work immediately,' he said.

Another London MP told the Guardian they were 'fiercely lobbying' for pubs, bars and restaurants to be re-opened in the capital.

Sadiq Khan told LBC yesterday: 'It's a bit early to say yet, but based on the numbers that I've seen, which is a slowdown in the virus spreading, it's coming down in parts of London in a couple of boroughs.'

'What I hope would happen is... London would probably be in what is called Tier Two.'

None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures from the seven-day spell ending November 15, the latest date for which data is available.

But in 20 of the 32 boroughs the infection rate rose last week, with the biggest jumps in Havering, Enfield and Redbridge.

The highest infection rate is in Havering, in the north-east of the city, the only borough where they surged above 300 per 100,000.

The number of patients being rushed to hospital in the capital suffering from Covid-19 remains low, according to the Department of Health, at a seven-day average of 154.7 admissions on November 17. But this is far below the peak of the first wave, when on average 748 patients were being taken to hospital with Covid-19 every day.

These levels are also among the lowest in the country, which ministers are expected to argue mean that London can be spared the sharpest curbs on public freedoms.

Mayors in the North of England are also mounting opposition to yet again being placed under higher tiers, with Sheffield city leader Dan Jarvis warning: 'We're willing to do our bit, but we must not be taken for granted.'

He added: 'Tougher restrictions have had a massive impact on South Yorkshire's economy.

'The Government said it will return to its levelling up agenda after the pandemic, but the brutal reality is we cannot wait that long.

'At Wednesday's Spending Review, the Government has a golden opportunity to deliver on its promises.

'I've pressed Ministers to bring forward major investment, to give the North the best chance of weathering the storm, ensure businesses survive a tough winter and allow us to kick start the job of economic recovery and renewal.'

Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham has come out hard against being plunged into the toughest measures.

Mr Burnham said a toughened Tier Three 'could be devastating for the hospitality industry and will hit cities and the city economy very, very hard indeed'.

Across England Swale, in Kent, has the worst infection rate in the country at 631.7 per 100,000.

Local leaders there have spoken of their 'frustration' that residents appear not to be following restrictions, and taking simple precautions such as wearing a face mask.

Swale's council leader, Roger Truelove, said lockdown rules in the borough were being 'willfully disregarded', with residents regularly not wearing face coverings and ignoring social distancing.

An emergency council meeting was held yesterday to discuss why the district - which is home to about 150,000 and includes the Isle of Sheppey - has seen such rapid growth of the virus.

THERE WAS ENOUGH INFORMATION ON COVID-19 TO ACT IN JANUARY, SAYS SCIENTIST Enough was known about coronavirus in January to act straight away, but the response was delayed, a leading scientist has said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said that while information about the virus was 'uncertain', action could have been taken. At the start of January the World Health Organisation was aware of a cluster of pneumonia cases - with no deaths - in Wuhan, China, and shared detailed information with member states. Speaking at the Imperial College London's Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics's (J-IDEA) symposium on a post-Covid world, Sir Jeremy said the response to the information was delayed. He said: 'The information you have early may be uncertain, but it's enough to act on. 'I would say that at the end of January we knew enough to have acted. And we waited. 'We waited out of uncertainty, we wanted to be more certain than we needed to be. 'But by the end of January, we knew that this was able to transmit asymptomatically, that it caused a nasty clinical syndrome and a significant number of people were dying, that healthcare workers were getting sick and distant family members were getting sick when people moved from Wuhan to Sichuan, that this was going out of China into other parts of south-east Asia, that we had no diagnostics, no treatment and no vaccines. 'To me, at the time - and this is not in retrospect - I think that was enough to have acted then in ways that we delayed.' Advertisement

The latest analysis of PHE figures, by the Press Association news agency, found Covid-19 case rates started to fall in most local areas across England in the most recent week, up to November 15.

Only two of nine regions - London and the South East - are still recording week-on-week rises in cases. The full impact of England's second national lockdown, however, is yet to become apparent in the data.

It takes up to two weeks for someone who has caught the virus to show symptoms, get tested, and receive a positive result. This means that many infections currently being reported may have occurred before the emergency measures were brought in.

But the latest figures suggest the numbers are heading in the right direction, though not in all parts of England.

The nationwide restrictions began on November 5, and the most recent figures are for the week ending November 15 – just 14 days into the lockdown.

Infection surges were recorded in 34 out of 67 local authorities in the South East, with Medway seeing the biggest jump.

Medway, in Kent, had the sixth biggest surge in infections in the country when they rose by 39.3 per cent to 299 per 100,000.

But the biggest week-on-week falls were recorded in the North West - signalling that earlier measures were helping to drive down cases alongside the lockdown.

Warrington saw the biggest fall in England, where infections dropped by 32.5 per cent to 259.6 per 100,000.

It was followed by Oldham, in Greater Manchester, where infections fell by 30.7 per cent to 519.2 per 100,000.

And Wigan saw the third biggest fall with a 30.3 per cent drop to 403.2 per 100,000.

When the tiered system returns on December 3, they will be reviewed every two weeks to establish whether local authorities need to have stricter curbs imposed or can be dropped to lower restrictions.

It is set to be in place until March 31, at which point the tiered system will come to an end.

Boris Johnson said last night that he hoped the country would be able to get back to normal 'by Easter', predicting this could be when the elderly and most vulnerable members of the population will have received a Covid-19 vaccine.

Three vaccines - including Oxford's jab - have said they are at least 70 per cent effective at triggering an immune response, prompting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to say 'the end of the tunnel' of the pandemic is in sight.

GRANT SHAPPS URGES BRITONS NOT TO USE TRAINS AT CHRISTMAS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE TOO BUSY Grant Shapps today urged Britons not to use trains at Christmas because they will be 'too busy' - as UK ministers meet to thrash out a plan to ease coronavirus rules so family reunions can happen. An announcement is imminent on proposals for a loosening over the festive season, with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove due to chair a Cobra meeting with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But the Transport Secretary has warned that the rail network's 'limitations', with major engineering work and capacity constraints, mean people should avoid using it where possible. In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Shapps said: 'We are going to be appealing to people to look very carefully at the transport route they take and of course even making a choice about whether they travel at all.' News on how restrictions on socialising will be relaxed for a few days - probably from December 23-27 - had been expected today, but might now come later in the week, as sources say 'details need ironing out'. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there could be a 'slight and careful' easing of the rules for a few days while Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething has suggested tough measures to control the virus before Christmas could allow 'more headroom for the festive season'. Mr Gove is set to chair a meeting with the devolved administrations later, in a bid to get the package over the line. Advertisement

The UK has ordered 100million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, with up to four million set to arrive this year. It is also expecting the first part of a delivery of 40million doses from Pfizer and BioNtech - who say their vaccine is 90 per cent effective - by the end of the year, and five million doses from Moderna - with a 94.5 per cent effective shot - in the spring next year.

Leaked NHS plans reveal they could start vaccinating the elderly and most vulnerable against the virus in early December, with vaccines being rolled out to the rest of the population in the new year.

But scientists have urged caution, warning none of the jabs have yet been approved for use by the UK's regulator the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The regulator reviews data on vaccine effectiveness and how safe it is before deciding whether or not to allow it to be administered across the country. It is a process that usually takes two years but, amid pressure to get life back to normal, the regulator has said it is working hard to make a decision quickly.

The Prime Minister detailed his winter strategy yesterday, with a plan to deploy a major testing scheme in an attempt to win over rebels on the Conservative backbenches.

He told tell MPs that non-essential shops can open in all three tiers after the current restrictions expire on December 2, in a boost for retailers.

Mr Johnson also set out the basis of plans to allow a small number of households across the UK to mix over a limited number of days around Christmas.

Vaccines and tiers – all your questions answered

When are we coming out of national lockdown?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the national lockdown imposed on November 5 will come to an end on December 2.

However, England will then move back into a regional tiered system of restrictions – similar to those introduced earlier this year.

What is the tier system?

There are three different tiers of restrictions, which will be imposed at a regional level depending on the number of coronavirus cases in that area.

Those living under Tier 1 restrictions will have the greatest freedoms, while people in Tiers 2 and 3 will face stricter measures.

Official testing data shows that coronavirus infection rates are falling across the North of England, where they were highest during the peak of the second wave, but they remain high in some areas of the West Midlands, Kent, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire (Darker colours indicate higher rates of positive tests per 100,000 people)

LONDON LOCKDOWN REVOLT: MPS WARN PUTTING CAPITAL IN T3 WOULD BE A 'DISASTER' In 20 of London's 32 regions last week there were increases in infection rates. The biggest jumps being Havering (up from 309.4 to 386.0), Enfield (up from 175.6 to 230.4) and Redbridge (up from 249.0 to 300.4) Boris Johnson has been warned by furious London Tories that it would be an economic 'disaster' if the capital was hit with the toughest possible coronavirus restrictions after lockdown ends. City MPs and the Conservative candidate for mayor, Shaun Bailey, sent the Prime Minister a clear warning after it emerged officials could place the metropolis into the top Tier 3 after December 2. They warned such a move could cripple London's entertainment and hospitality industries, with pubs and restaurants open for takeaway and delivery sales only and theatres and other venues remaining closed. None of London's boroughs have a Covid-19 infection rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people, according to Public Health England figures. But speaking to business leaders via Zoom last night, Mr Bailey said: 'I absolutely agree it would be a disaster for London if we were in Tier 3. Advertisement

How will they decide on what tier to introduce?

Regions with high numbers of cases will face tighter measures, while those with fewer cases will have their restrictions relaxed.

To decide which tier to apply to a specific area, officials will look at coronavirus cases across all age groups, and specifically among the over-60s who are considered most at risk.

They will also consider whether infection rates are rising or falling and the prevalence of the disease per 100,000 of the population.

When will I find out what tier I'm in?

An announcement will be made on Thursday.

What is allowed under each tier?

Under Tier 1, people can meet a maximum of six friends or family outdoors or indoors.

Pubs and restaurants can reopen, but with table service only and an 11pm closing time.

In Tier 2, people from two different households cannot mix indoors, and outdoor gatherings will be limited to six.

Pubs will remain closed unless operating as restaurants, with alcohol only served as part of a 'substantial meal'.

Retail and personal care – such as hairdressers and beauty salons – can reopen in all tiers, and indoor entertainment venues – such as cinemas, theatres, bowling alleys and casinos – will be allowed to stay open in Tiers 1 and 2, but not Tier 3.

Tier 3 areas will see the hospitality sector remain closed except for takeaways, and groups of six will only be able to meet in outdoor public spaces.

Can I travel between tiers?

People in Tier 3 areas should avoid travelling to other parts of the UK, including for overnight stays unless it is for work, education, health or care requirements.

Likewise, those in Tier 1 and 2 areas should not travel to Tier 3 zones, but can pass through them as part of a longer journey.

Should I start making plans for Christmas?

Not just yet. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was unable to confirm on Monday any details as to how people would be able to spend the festive period.

However, a plan to allow families to be reunited for Christmas is being developed with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

HANCOCK CLAIMS T3 WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH BEFORE LOCKDOWN Matt Hancock has claimed Tier Three restrictions imposed before lockdown were not tough enough to halt the spread of Covid-19, and revealed he hopes damaging restrictions on Britons lives will be lifted after Easter. Speaking to Parliament's Health and Social Care Committee, the 'architect' of the tiered system said he was convinced a second lockdown was needed when cases suddenly surged in all areas of England. The then-spiralling numbers, he said, meant that 'even in the lower prevalence areas you could see they were going to get to high prevalence if we didn't act'. Public Health England data reveals the sharpest spike in infections across England was in the week ending October 4, when almost every local authority saw Covid-19 infections surge by more than 50 per cent. Ministers then rushed out the tiered system - which came into force on October 14 - in an attempt to suppress escalating cases. But just 23 days later - and amid growing evidence that Tier Three was driving down infections - they hit the nuclear button and imposed a second nationwide lockdown. The Health Secretary and Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove are thought to have been the main supporters of the stringent measures in the cabinet. Mr Hancock appeared today in front of the committee to answer questions on the Government's handling of the pandemic, including whether Test and Trace is working, whether the first lockdown was imposed early enough and why a circuit breaker was avoided. Boris Johnson yesterday unveiled his beefed-up tier system, with Tier Three now forcing all restaurants and bars to shift to take-away only. Advertisement

Is there a vaccine yet?

Not quite. Although vaccine developers have started to publish the interim results from their trials, which have so far been positive.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca team announced its vaccine had proved up to 90% effective.

When will it be ready?

No one can be certain at this stage as no vaccine has been approved for use yet.

But the jab is likely to be rolled out in the UK from December, with the bulk of vaccination in the new year.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, if all goes well in the next couple of weeks, the vaccination programme could potentially be rolled out from next month for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.

Will I have to pay for a jab?

No, the vaccine will be free on the NHS.

Will there be enough for everyone?

The Government said it has secured access to more than 350 million doses of vaccine from seven developers between now and the end of 2021, which is enough to potentially vaccinate the whole population.

Do I have to get a vaccine?

There are no plans to make vaccination compulsory, Downing Street said earlier in November.

However, Mr Hancock has also refused to rule out making it mandatory.

How long will immunity last?

The Government said in its Covid Winter Plan that the exact strength and duration of immunity provided through vaccination is not yet known.

Protection through vaccination takes time to build and requires a full course, but it is still unknown how well the first vaccines will stop the virus from passing between people.

Can I choose what vaccine I get?

As things stand, the vaccines will be rolled out as and when they become available, depending on which are approved first and how quickly companies can make them.

No announcement has been made on whether one might be given priority over another as they become ready on a mass scale.

People are not expected to be able to choose which jab they want to receive.

When will life return to normal?

While it is not known exactly how long it might take for the population to be vaccinated, Mr Hancock has said it is looking as though things may start returning to normal after Easter.

But until then, and until there is some kind of herd immunity in the population, achieved through vaccination, people will need to continue to wear face masks, socially distance and wash their hands.";"(2020-03-12)

# How to Find and Follow a Sleep Routine That’s Right for You

Your body and brain thrive on routine — and part of what sets that routine is a consistent sleep schedule. “Your brain releases hormones that make you sleepy and awake at certain times,” says Samantha Anders, PhD, a Minneapolis-based psychologist in private practice who treats insomnia and sleep disorders.

The more you stick to that schedule, the stronger those sleep and wake signals get (meaning you spend less time tossing and turning before sleep when you turn in and feel more alert when it’s time to wake).

So what’s the ideal schedule for you? The recommendation from the National Sleep Foundation is for adults to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep at night — note that sleep needs change slightly for people of different ages. But health organizations recommend sleep ranges (rather than a specific amount) because we’re all slightly different, too.

“Everyone has a different natural rhythm when it comes to their sleep, which is partly hereditary,” says Dr. Anders. Of course, behavioral habits and lifestyle factors come into play. For example, you may need to wake up at a certain time for work or to get kids off to school, which helps train your body to follow a certain schedule. You may be on electronic devices late at night, and the blue light they emit can shift your clock to a later bedtime.

How to Tell if You’re Getting Enough Sleep

If you’re getting the amount of sleep you personally need, you’ll feel awake and alert all day long. While it’s natural to experience a slight dip in energy in the afternoon, you should not be struggling to stay awake at 3 p.m., says Anders. “You should feel with-it and be able to think clearly.”

MORE ON SELF-CARE The Ultimate Self-Care Workbook Learn More Another hint that you’re on track with a sleep schedule that’s working for you is if you feel really sleepy before bedtime. Another hint that you’re on track with a sleep schedule that’s working for you is if you feel really sleepy before bedtime.

But, it’s worth pointing out that there are a lot of factors that affect your biological clock and make you feel more or less awake, whether you’re getting enough sleep or not, says Anders. “Light and stimulation are two big ones,” she explains.

What foods you’re eating or drinking, when you’re physically active (or not), stress, and when you’re exposing your eyes to a lot of blue light (either from the sun or screens), can affect how sleepy or awake you feel, too. For example, even if your body is ready for sleep in the evening, artificial light as well as staring at a phone or TV sends signals to the brain to stay awake, says Anders. If you’re feeling anxious about meeting a big deadline at work, stress signals may be overriding signs from your body that you’re actually overtired.

If you’re still unsure whether or not your sleep routine is working for you, think back to the last time you took a weeklong vacation and didn’t have to set an alarm. How much sleep did you need then? Where did your natural sleep patterns fall when you had extended time off and didn’t have to sleep at specific times for work or school? Paying attention to where your body naturally falls when it’s not affected by these external factors will help you uncover the pattern that works best for your body, as well as how much sleep your body really needs.

And if you stick to that pattern (more on how to do that below), the better you’ll feel and function.

The more consistent you are with your sleep the better you’ll feel — and the easier sleep will come, says Alex Dimitriu, MD, a dual-board certified doctor in psychiatry and sleep medicine in private practice in Menlo Park, California. “Everyone thinks that sleep is a one-night commitment, but the annoying thing about sleep is that one night alone will rarely make up for past sleep deprivation,” he says.

Consistent sleep benefits your long-term health, too. Case in point: A study published in August 2019 in Diabetes Care found that irregular bed and wake times were linked to metabolic problems like high blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar; for every one hour of variability in sleep schedule, the risk of having metabolic syndrome rose by 27 percent.

My Sleep Schedule Isn’t Working for Me — but I Don’t Have Time to Change It!

If you struggle to prioritize sleep over other responsibilities (or late-night Netflix), and are looking for some additional motivation, focus on what sleep does for you, says Anders. When you get enough do you feel happier? Do you eat better and do better at your job? “It has to be your own individual motivation. Determine how sleep affects what you care about in your life, and it will be easier to make it a priority,” she says.

RELATED: How to Start a Self-Care Routine You’ll Follow

Of course, sometimes it’s not a matter of not being motivated to sleep — it’s a matter of other obligations getting in the way, like crying babies, second jobs, night school, and so much more. It’s helpful to know that the more consistent you can keep your sleep schedule when you can and the fewer nights you cut your sleep short, the better your body will feel in the short and long run.

For Jennifer Ashton, MD, the chief medical correspondent of ABC News, a consistent sleep-wake schedule wasn’t a problem; it was the duration of slumber that had fallen short for her in the previous few years.

Dr. Ashton suspected she’d thrive on getting more than the seven-ish hours she was currently logging with her early wake-up times for Good Morning America. “I was curious to know whether trying to get that extra thirty minutes to an hour back would make any difference in my energy, appetite, workouts, or mental acuity,” she wrote in her book The Self-Care Solution: A Year of Becoming Happier, Healthier, and Fitter — One Month at a Time.

RELATED: What Is Self-Care and Why Is It So Important for Your Health?

One thing that helped Ashton determine how much sleep she should get was Sleep Cycle, an app that uses sound and movement to track how much you sleep at night. With the data it provided, she was able to connect the dots on how much sleep she got at night and how she felt the next day. Ashton noticed that when she got at least eight hours of sleep, she was “noticeably more energetic” than with her normal seven hours.

After a month of trying to make those daily eight hours of sleep a priority, Ashton reaped big rewards, she says: “I was more productive, efficient, effective, and — a new adjective for the month — noticeably happier. With more sleep, I felt better about myself and life at large,” she wrote.

7 Tips for Optimizing Your Sleep Schedule

You know you should stay off your phone before bed and not eat too close to bedtime. But what can you do to specifically figure out the length and timing of sleep that works best for your body? What cues should you pay attention to from your body? Here’s what Anders and Dr. Dimitriu say.

1. Give Yourself 8 Hours

No matter when you set your wake and bedtime, allow an eight-hour window for sleep, says Dimitriu. You may end up getting less (and you will likely spend some time falling asleep) but make sure the opportunity to sleep is there.

2. Set Your Bedtime by Your Wake Time

Look at what time you need to get up. This time should give you enough time in the morning so you can get ready for your day without feeling rushed and should allow you to get to work or school on time. From there, count backward eight hours, and boom, that’s your ideal bedtime, says Dimitriu.

3. Find What’s Right for Your Body and Your Schedule

Notice how there’s no guideline that you must go to bed at 10 p.m.? “Everyone has a different natural rhythm, and it’s partly hereditary,” says Anders. Some people are night owls and prefer a later bedtime, and there are those who are larks who feel more energized waking up before or with the sunrise, and therefore tend to hit the hay earlier.

That said, your professional, educational, or family responsibilities may not fit in line with your biological clock. If you tend to go to bed late (say, 1 or 2 a.m.) and that’s preventing you from getting the sleep you need because you have to be awake at 7 a.m. to start your job, you need to shift your circadian rhythm back so that you can go to bed earlier, says Anders.

Limit the amount of blue light (emitted from electronic devices) you get within two to three hours of bedtime. If that’s not possible, at least wear blue-blocking glasses, she says. Electronic devices tend to keep you awake for other reasons (work or the content you’re consuming may be alerting), so it’s still preferable to work on a screen-reducing strategy.

4. Beat the Clock

Even when Ashton was busy with social or work events, she’d make sure that those things fit around her sleep schedule — not the other way around. This helped her stick to her commitment to get more sleep while not feeling like she was missing out on anything.

“I knew that if I wanted to keep sleeping for eight hours, I had to focus on continuing to go to bed earlier rather than trying to sleep later the next day. With GMA, I can’t really mess around with my wake-up time: It’s usually 5 a.m. or 5:20 a.m. at the latest, although it can be as early as 4:20 a.m.,” says Ashton. As a result, she knew that for eight hours of sleep, she had to be in bed between 9 and 9:30 p.m.

As a result, when out with friends, Ashton says she’d leave at a reasonable time and then get ready for bed as soon as she got home. If she was finishing work or other projects, she’d challenge herself to stay focused and work with efficiency to finish up before bedtime.

5. Keep Your Routine Intact on the Weekends

Saturday and Sunday are not the days to sleep in two or three hours — that can throw off your sleep routine. Come Sunday night, you won’t be tired for your normally appointed bedtime.

A half hour of sleep-in time on days off is reasonable, says Dimitriu.

6. Brush Your Teeth Early in the Evening

Consider this one a small hack that helps you avoid late night snacking. “Late night snacking keeps you up,” says Dimitriu. Not only can certain foods cause heartburn or contain caffeine that keeps you awake (like chocolate), but eating before bed can be taxing on your digestive system, which diminishes sleep quality, too.

7. Cut Yourself Off From Caffeine by Noon

You may have heard this unofficial rule before, but do you know why? Caffeine has a “half-life” of four to six hours, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). That’s how much time it takes for your body to metabolize half the caffeine. So, for some people, if they drink 20 ounces of coffee at noon, by 6 p.m., it’s as if 10 ounces is still in their system, says Dimitriu. While many people can drink coffee at night and have no problem, for most of us, having coffee in the later afternoon will cut into our sleep — and throw off this all-important sleep routine.";"(2019-12-13)
# Are sleep routines useful for kids?

";no;supporting;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;yes;supporting;The article emphasizes the importance of consistent sleep schedules for overall well-being and performance. It suggests that maintaining a regular sleep routine helps strengthen the body's natural sleep and wake signals, leading to better sleep quality and daytime alertness. The article also mentions that irregular sleep patterns can have negative effects on metabolism and overall health, as supported by a study cited in Diabetes Care. Additionally, it provides practical tips for optimizing sleep schedules, such as setting bedtime based on wake time, limiting blue light exposure, and avoiding late-night caffeine and snacks. The stance is clearly supportive of the idea that sleep routines are beneficial and should be prioritized for better health and functioning.;2567;154

# Anxiety Associated With Faster Alzheimer’s Disease Onset

Summary: Anxiety may accelerate the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. Brain scans revealed patients who progressed from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease had decreased volume in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

Anxiety is associated with an increased rate of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study being presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Alzheimer’s disease represents a major public health crisis worldwide. The number of deaths from the disease has more than doubled since 2000, and it is currently the fifth-leading cause of death among individuals over 65 in the U.S.

Many people with Alzheimer’s disease first suffer from mild cognitive impairment, a decline in cognitive abilities like memory and thinking skills that is more rapid than normally associated with aging. Anxiety has been frequently observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment, although its role in disease progression is not well understood.

“We know that volume loss in certain areas of the brain is a factor that predicts progression to Alzheimer’s disease,” said study senior author Maria Vittoria Spampinato, M.D., professor of radiology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston. “In this study, we wanted to see if anxiety had an effect on brain structure, or if the effect of anxiety was independent from brain structure in favoring the progression of disease.”

The study group included 339 patients, average age of 72 years, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 cohort. Each person had a baseline diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment; 72 progressed to Alzheimer’s disease while 267 remained stable.

The researchers obtained brain MRIs to determine the baseline volumes of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, two areas important to forming memories. They also tested for the presence of the ApoE4 allele, the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Anxiety was measured with established clinical surveys.

As expected, patients who progressed to Alzheimer’s disease had significantly lower volumes in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex and greater frequency of the ApoE4 allele. Most notably though, the researchers found that anxiety was independently associated with cognitive decline.

“Mild cognitive impairment patients with anxiety symptoms developed Alzheimer’s disease faster than individuals without anxiety, independently of whether they had a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease or brain volume loss,” said study first author Jenny L. Ulber, a medical student at MUSC.

The link between anxiety symptoms and a faster progression to Alzheimer’s disease presents an opportunity for improving the screening and management of patients with early mild cognitive impairment, the researchers said.

“We need to better understand the association between anxiety disorders and cognitive decline,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We don’t know yet if the anxiety is a symptom–in other words, their memory is getting worse and they become anxious–or if anxiety contributes to cognitive decline. If we were able in the future to find that anxiety is actually causing progression, then we should more aggressively screen for anxiety disorders in the elderly.”

“The geriatric population is routinely screened for depression in many hospitals, but perhaps this vulnerable population should also be assessed for anxiety disorders,” Ulber added. “Middle-aged and elderly individuals with high level of anxiety may benefit from intervention, whether it be pharmacological or cognitive behavioral therapy, with the goal of slowing cognitive decline.”

The study was based on MRI scans done at one point in time. For future research, the team would like to study MRIs obtained after the initial scan to better understand the connection between anxiety and brain structure.

“We’re now interested in looking at changes over time to see if anxiety has an effect one way or the other on how fast the brain damage progresses,” Dr. Spampinato said. “We will also take a closer look at gender differences in the association between anxiety and cognitive decline.”

# The first COVID-19 vaccines won’t end the U.S. crisis right away

Don’t even think of putting your mask away anytime soon.

Despite the expected arrival of the first COVID-19 vaccines in just a few weeks, it could take several months — probably well into 2021 — before things get back to something close to normal in the U.S. and Americans can once again go to the movies, cheer at an NBA game or give Grandma a hug.

The first, limited shipments of the vaccine would mark just the beginning of what could be a long and messy road toward the end of the pandemic that has upended life and killed more than a quarter-million people in the U.S. In the meantime, Americans are being warned not to let their guard down.

“If you’re fighting a battle and the cavalry is on the way, you don’t stop shooting; you keep going until the cavalry gets here, and then you might even want to continue fighting,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said last week.

This week, AstraZeneca became the third vaccine maker to say early data indicates its shots are highly effective. Pfizer last week asked the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization to begin distributing its vaccine, and Moderna is expected to do the same any day. Federal officials say the first doses will ship within a day of authorization.

But most people will probably have to wait months for shots to become widely available. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines also both require two doses, meaning people will have to go back for a second shot after three and four weeks, respectively, to get the full protection.

Moncef Slaoui, head of the U.S. vaccine development effort, said on CNN on Sunday that early data on the Pfizer and Moderna shots suggest about 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity — a milestone he said is likely to be reached in May.

But along the way, experts say the logistical challenges of the biggest vaccination campaign in U.S. history and public fear and misinformation could hinder the effort and kick the end of the pandemic further down the road.

“It’s going to be a slow process and it’s going to be a process with ups and downs, like we’ve seen already,” said Dr. Bill Moss, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University.

Once federal officials give a vaccine the go-ahead, doses that are already being stockpiled will be deployed with the goal of “putting needles in people’s arms” within 24 to 48 hours, said Paul Mango, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official involved in the Operation Warp Speed effort to develop COVID-19 vaccines.

Those first shipments are expected to be limited and will be directed to high-risk groups at designated locations, such as frontline healthcare workers at hospitals.

Federal and state officials are still figuring out exactly how to prioritize those most at risk, including the elderly, prison inmates and homeless people. By the end of January, HHS officials say, all senior citizens should be able to get shots, assuming a vaccine becomes available by the end of 2020.

For everyone else, they expect widespread availability of vaccines would start a couple of months later.

To make shots easily accessible, state and federal officials are enlisting a vast network of providers, such as pharmacies and doctor’s offices.

But some worry long lines won’t be the problem.

“One of the things that may be a factor that hasn’t been discussed that much is: How many will be willing to be vaccinated?” said Christine Finley, director of Vermont’s immunization program. She noted that the accelerated development of the vaccine and the politics around it have fueled worries about safety.

Even if the first vaccines prove as effective as suggested by early data, they won’t have much impact if enough people don’t get them.

Vaccines aren’t always effective in everyone: Over the past decade, for example, seasonal flu vaccines have been effective in from 20% to 60% of people who get them.

AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna say early trial data suggests their vaccine candidates are about 90% or more effective. But those rates could change by the time the studies end.

Also, the definition of “effective” can vary.

Rather than prevent infection entirely, the first COVID-19 vaccines might only prevent illness. Vaccinated people might still be able to contract and transmit the virus, another reason experts say masks will remain crucial for some time.

Another important aspect of vaccines: They can take awhile to work.

The first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine might bring about a degree of protection within a couple of weeks, meaning people who get infected might not get as sick as they otherwise would. But full protection could take up to two weeks after the second shot — or about six weeks after the first shot, said Deborah Fuller, a vaccine expert at the University of Washington.

People who don’t understand that lag could mistakenly think the vaccine made them sick if they happen to come down with COVID-19 soon after a shot. People might also blame the vaccine for unrelated health problems and amplify those fears online.

“All you need is a few people getting on social media,” Moss said.

There’s also the possibility of real side effects. COVID-19 vaccine trials have to include at least 30,000 people, but the chances of a rare side effect turning up are more likely as growing numbers of people are vaccinated.

Even if a link between the vaccine and a possible side effect seems likely, distribution of the shots might not be halted if the risk is deemed small and is outweighed by the benefits, said Dr. Wilbur Chen, a vaccine expert at the University of Maryland.

But Chen said public health officials will need to clearly explain the relative risks to avoid public panic.

Depending on whether the virus mutates in coming years and how long the vaccine’s protection lasts, booster shots later on may also be necessary, said Dr. Edward Belongia, a vaccine researcher with the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Wisconsin.

Belongia and many others say the coronavirus won’t ever be stamped out and will become one of the many seasonal viruses that sicken people. How quickly will vaccines help reduce the threat of the virus to that level?

“At this point, we just need to wait and see,” Belongia said.";"(2019-12-13)

# The United States' top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said people in the U.S. do not need to wear masks to protect against COVID-19.

Did Anthony Fauci Say People No Longer Need to Wear Masks?
An old interview with Dr. Fauci made new rounds on social media during the coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020.
Another rumor about the efficacy of wearing masks during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic made the rounds in June 2020, a topic we have debunked numerous times at Snopes. A “60 Minutes” interview from early March 2020 with Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the leading members of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force, was being regurgitated on social media. In the segment,  Fauci said there was no reason people in the U.S. needed to wear a mask.
The problem? That clip is old, and Fauci was simply echoing what many others argued at that time, including the U.S. Surgeon General, the World Health Organization (WHO), and The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since then, Fauci’s views and that of most organizations have changed, as more information became available about the disease.





In the March 2020 clip, Fauci said: “Right now in the United States people should not be walking around with masks … You should think of healthcare providers who are needing them and the people who are ill.” 
Since at least April 2020, the CDC recommended that everyone wear cloth masks in public to help slow the spread of COVID-19. That recommendation changed because of studies that found even people without coronavirus symptoms, but who may still have the disease, could transmit the virus through close interactions with others, especially through speaking, coughing, and sneezing: 
In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) … 
Snopes has also covered the efficacy of masks in past fact checks, including the evolving recommendations of the U.S. surgeon general and the effectiveness of cloth masks in preventing the spread of the virus. 
Fauci also clarified in a June interview that masks are helpful “… but it’s masks plus physical separation.” This is in line with the CDC guideline that, “The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing.”
Given that the quote from Fauci is no longer current, we rate this claim as “Outdated.”";no;contradicting;Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview;yes;contradicting;The article discusses the evolving stance on mask usage during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting that earlier recommendations against widespread mask usage have changed as more information became available.

The article emphasizes the importance of masks in preventing the spread of the virus, especially from asymptomatic carriers.;2004;108
